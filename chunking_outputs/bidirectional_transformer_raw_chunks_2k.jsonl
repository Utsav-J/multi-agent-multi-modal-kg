Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pretrain deep bidirectional representations from\nunlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both\nleft and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be finetuned with just one additional output layer\nto create state-of-the-art models for a wide\n\nrange of tasks, such as question answering and\nlanguage inference, without substantial taskspecific architecture modifications.\n\n\nBERT is conceptually simple and empirically\npowerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing\ntasks, including pushing the GLUE score to\n80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement),\nMultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute\nimprovement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1\n(5.1 point absolute improvement).\n\n\n**1** **Introduction**\n\n\nLanguage model pre-training has been shown to\nbe effective for improving many natural language\nprocessing tasks (Dai and Le, 2015; Peters et al.,\n2018a; Radford et al., 2018; Howard and Ruder,\n2018). These include sentence-level tasks such as\nnatural language inference (Bowman et al., 2015;\nWilliams et al., 2018) and paraphrasing (Dolan\nand Brockett, 2005), which aim to predict the relationships between sentences by analyzing them\nholistically, as well as token-level tasks such as\nnamed entity recognition and question answering,\nwhere models are required to produce fine-grained\noutput at the token level (Tjong Kim Sang and\nDe Meulder, 2003; Rajpurkar et al., 2016).\n\n\n\nThere are two existing strategies for applying pre-trained language representations to downstream tasks: _feature-based_ and _fine-tuning_ . The\nfeature-based approach, such as ELMo (Peters\net al., 2018a), uses task-specific architectures that\ninclude the pre-trained representations as additional features. The fine-tuning approach, such as\nthe Generative Pre-trained Transformer (OpenAI\nGPT) (Radford et al., 2018), introduces minimal\ntask-specific parameters, and is trained on the\ndownstream tasks by simply fine-tuning _all_ pretrained parameters. The two approaches share the\nsame objective function during pre-training, where\nthey use unidirectional language models to learn\ngeneral language representations.\nWe argue that current techniques restrict the\npower of the pre-trained representations, especially for the fine-tuning approaches. The major limitation is that standard language models are\nunidirectional, and this limits the choice of architectures that can be used during pre-training. For\nexample, in OpenAI GPT, the authors use a left-toright architecture, where every token can only attend to previous tokens in the self-attention layers\nof the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017). Such restrictions are sub-optimal for sentence-level tasks,\nand could be very harmful when applying finetuning based approaches to token-level tasks such\nas question answering, where it is crucial to incorporate context from both directions.\nIn this paper, we improve the fine-tuning based\napproaches by proposing BERT: **B** idirectional\n**E** ncoder **R** epresentations from **T** ransformers.\nBERT alleviates the previously mentioned unidirectionality constraint by using a \u201cmasked language model\u201d (MLM) pre-training objective, inspired by the Cloze task (Taylor, 1953). The\nmasked language model randomly masks some of\nthe tokens from the input, and the objective is to\npredict the original vocabulary id of the masked\n\n\nword based only on its context. Unlike left-toright language model pre-training, the MLM objective enables the representation to fuse the left\nand the right context, which allows us to pretrain a deep bidirectional Transformer. In addition to the masked language model, we also use\na \u201cnext sentence prediction\u201d task that jointly pretrains text-pair representations. The contributions\nof our paper are as follows:\n\n\n- We demonstrate the importance of bidirectional\npre-training for language representations. Unlike Radford et al. (2018), which uses unidirectional language models for pre-training, BERT\nuses masked language models to enable pretrained deep bidirectional representations. This\nis also in contrast to Peters et al. (2018a), which\nuses a shallow concatenation of independently\ntrained left-to-right and right-to-left LMs.\n\n\n- We show that pre-trained representations reduce\nthe need for many heavily-engineered taskspecific architectures. BERT is the first finetuning based representation model that achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on a large suite\nof sentence-level _and_ token-level tasks, outperforming many task-specific architectures.\n\n\n- BERT advances the state of the art for eleven\n\nNLP tasks. The code and pre-trained mod[els are available at https://github.com/](https://github.com/google-research/bert)\n[google-research/bert.](https://github.com/google-research/bert)\n\n\n**2** **Related Work**\n\n\nThere is a long history of pre-training general language representations, and we briefly review the\nmost widely-used approaches in this section.\n\n\n**2.1** **Unsupervised Feature-based Approaches**\n\n\nLearning widely applicable representations of\nwords has been an active area of research for\n\ndecades, including non-neural (Brown et al., 1992;\nAndo and Zhang, 2005; Blitzer et al., 2006) and\nneural (Mikolov et al., 2013; Pennington et al.,\n2014) methods. Pre-trained word embeddings\nare an integral part of modern NLP systems, offering significant improvements over embeddings\nlearned from scratch (Turian et al., 2010). To pretrain word embedding vectors, left-to-right language modeling objectives have been used (Mnih\nand Hinton, 2009), as well as objectives to discriminate correct from incorrect words in left and\n\nright context (Mikolov et al., 2013).\n\n\n\nThese approaches have been generalized to\ncoarser granularities, such as sentence embeddings (Kiros et al., 2015; Logeswaran and Lee,\n2018) or paragraph embeddings (Le and Mikolov,\n2014). To train sentence representations, prior\nwork has used objectives to rank candidate next\nsentences (Jernite et al., 2017; Logeswaran and\nLee, 2018), left-to-right generation of next sentence words given a representation of the previous\nsentence (Kiros et al., 2015), or denoising autoencoder derived objectives (Hill et al., 2016).\n\nELMo and its predecessor (Peters et al., 2017,\n2018a) generalize traditional word embedding research along a different dimension. They extract\n_context-sensitive_ features from a left-to-right and a\nright-to-left language model. The contextual representation of each token is the concatenation of\n\nthe left-to-right and right-to-left representations.\nWhen integrating contextual word embeddings\nwith existing task-specific architectures, ELMo\nadvances the state of the art for several major NLP\nbenchmarks (Peters et al., 2018a) including question answering (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), sentiment\nanalysis (Socher et al., 2013), and named entity\nrecognition (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder,\n2003). Melamud et al. (2016) proposed learning\ncontextual representations through a task to predict a single word from both left and right context\nusing LSTMs. Similar to ELMo, their model is\nfeature-based and not deeply bidirectional. Fedus\net al. (2018) shows that the cloze task can be used\nto improve the robustness of text generation models.\n\n\n**2.2** **Unsupervised Fine-tuning Approaches**\n\n\nAs with the feature-based approaches, the first\nworks in this direction only pre-trained word embedding parameters from unlabeled text (Collobert and Weston, 2008).", "metadata": {"source": "bidirectional_transformer_raw.md"}, "chunk_index": 0, "token_size_config": 2000}

The advantage of these approaches\nis that few parameters need to be learned from\nscratch. At least partly due to this advantage,\nOpenAI GPT (Radford et al., 2018) achieved previously state-of-the-art results on many sentencelevel tasks from the GLUE benchmark (Wang\net al., 2018a).

Apart from output layers, the same architectures are used in both pre-training and fine-tuning. The same pre-trained model parameters are used to initialize\nmodels for different down-stream tasks. During fine-tuning, all parameters are fine-tuned. [CLS] is a special\nsymbol added in front of every input example, and [SEP] is a special separator token (e.g. separating questions/answers).\n\n\n\ning and auto-encoder objectives have been used\nfor pre-training such models (Howard and Ruder,\n2018; Radford et al., 2018; Dai and Le, 2015).\n\n\n**2.3** **Transfer Learning from Supervised Data**\n\n\nThere has also been work showing effective transfer from supervised tasks with large datasets, such\nas natural language inference (Conneau et al.,\n2017) and machine translation (McCann et al.,\n2017). Computer vision research has also demonstrated the importance of transfer learning from\nlarge pre-trained models, where an effective recipe\nis to fine-tune models pre-trained with ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009; Yosinski et al., 2014).\n\n\n**3** **BERT**\n\n\nWe introduce BERT and its detailed implementation in this section. There are two steps in our\nframework: _pre-training_ and _fine-tuning_ . During pre-training, the model is trained on unlabeled\ndata over different pre-training tasks. For finetuning, the BERT model is first initialized with\nthe pre-trained parameters, and all of the parameters are fine-tuned using labeled data from the\ndownstream tasks. Each downstream task has separate fine-tuned models, even though they are initialized with the same pre-trained parameters. The\nquestion-answering example in Figure 1 will serve\nas a running example for this section.\nA distinctive feature of BERT is its unified architecture across different tasks. There is mini\n\n\nmal difference between the pre-trained architecture and the final downstream architecture.\n\n\n**Model Architecture** BERT\u2019s model architec\nture is a multi-layer bidirectional Transformer encoder based on the original implementation described in Vaswani et al. (2017) and released in\nthe tensor2tensor library. [1] Because the use\nof Transformers has become common and our im\nplementation is almost identical to the original,\nwe will omit an exhaustive background description of the model architecture and refer readers to\n\nVaswani et al. (2017) as well as excellent guides\nsuch as \u201cThe Annotated Transformer.\u201d [2]\n\n\nIn this work, we denote the number of layers\n(i.e., Transformer blocks) as _L_, the hidden size as\n_H_, and the number of self-attention heads as _A_ . [3]\n\nWe primarily report results on two model sizes:\n**BERTBASE** (L=12, H=768, A=12, Total Parameters=110M) and **BERTLARGE** (L=24, H=1024,\nA=16, Total Parameters=340M).\n\nBERTBASE was chosen to have the same model\nsize as OpenAI GPT for comparison purposes.\nCritically, however, the BERT Transformer uses\nbidirectional self-attention, while the GPT Transformer uses constrained self-attention where every\ntoken can only attend to context to its left. [4]\n\n\n1https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor\n2http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html\n3In all cases we set the feed-forward/filter size to be 4 _H_,\ni.e., 3072 for the _H_ = 768 and 4096 for the _H_ = 1024.\n4We note that in the literature the bidirectional Trans\n\n**Input/Output Representations** To make BERT\nhandle a variety of down-stream tasks, our input\nrepresentation is able to unambiguously represent\nboth a single sentence and a pair of sentences\n(e.g., _\u27e8_ Question, Answer _\u27e9_ ) in one token sequence.\nThroughout this work, a \u201csentence\u201d can be an arbitrary span of contiguous text, rather than an actual\nlinguistic sentence. A \u201csequence\u201d refers to the input token sequence to BERT, which may be a single sentence or two sentences packed together.\nWe use WordPiece embeddings (Wu et al.,\n2016) with a 30,000 token vocabulary. The first\ntoken of every sequence is always a special classification token ([CLS]). The final hidden state\ncorresponding to this token is used as the aggregate sequence representation for classification\ntasks. Sentence pairs are packed together into a\nsingle sequence. We differentiate the sentences in\ntwo ways. First, we separate them with a special\ntoken ([SEP]). Second, we add a learned embedding to every token indicating whether it belongs\nto sentence A or sentence B. As shown in Figure 1,\nwe denote input embedding as _E_, the final hidden\nvector of the special [CLS] token as _C \u2208_ R _[H]_,\nand the final hidden vector for the _i_ [th] input token\nas _Ti \u2208_ R _[H]_ .\nFor a given token, its input representation is\nconstructed by summing the corresponding token,\nsegment, and position embeddings. A visualization of this construction can be seen in Figure 2.\n\n\n**3.1** **Pre-training BERT**\n\n\nUnlike Peters et al. (2018a) and Radford et al.\n(2018), we do not use traditional left-to-right or\nright-to-left language models to pre-train BERT.\nInstead, we pre-train BERT using two unsupervised tasks, described in this section. This step\nis presented in the left part of Figure 1.\n\n\n**Task #1: Masked LM** Intuitively, it is reasonable to believe that a deep bidirectional model is\nstrictly more powerful than either a left-to-right\nmodel or the shallow concatenation of a left-to\nright and a right-to-left model. Unfortunately,\nstandard conditional language models can only be\ntrained left-to-right _or_ right-to-left, since bidirectional conditioning would allow each word to indirectly \u201csee itself\u201d, and the model could trivially\npredict the target word in a multi-layered context.\n\n\nformer is often referred to as a \u201cTransformer encoder\u201d while\nthe left-context-only version is referred to as a \u201cTransformer\ndecoder\u201d since it can be used for text generation.", "metadata": {"source": "bidirectional_transformer_raw.md"}, "chunk_index": 1, "token_size_config": 2000}

We refer to this procedure as a \u201cmasked\nLM\u201d (MLM), although it is often referred to as a\n_Cloze_ task in the literature (Taylor, 1953). In this\ncase, the final hidden vectors corresponding to the\nmask tokens are fed into an output softmax over\nthe vocabulary, as in a standard LM. In all of our\nexperiments, we mask 15% of all WordPiece tokens in each sequence at random. In contrast to\ndenoising auto-encoders (Vincent et al., 2008), we\nonly predict the masked words rather than reconstructing the entire input.\nAlthough this allows us to obtain a bidirectional pre-trained model, a downside is that we\nare creating a mismatch between pre-training and\nfine-tuning, since the [MASK] token does not appear during fine-tuning. To mitigate this, we do\nnot always replace \u201cmasked\u201d words with the actual [MASK] token. The training data generator\nchooses 15% of the token positions at random for\nprediction. If the _i_ -th token is chosen, we replace\nthe _i_ -th token with (1) the [MASK] token 80% of\nthe time (2) a random token 10% of the time (3)\nthe unchanged _i_ -th token 10% of the time. Then,\n_Ti_ will be used to predict the original token with\ncross entropy loss. We compare variations of this\nprocedure in Appendix C.2.\n\n\n**Task #2:** **Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)**\nMany important downstream tasks such as Question Answering (QA) and Natural Language Inference (NLI) are based on understanding the _rela-_\n_tionship_ between two sentences, which is not directly captured by language modeling. In order\nto train a model that understands sentence rela\ntionships, we pre-train for a binarized _next sen-_\n_tence prediction_ task that can be trivially generated from any monolingual corpus. Specifically,\nwhen choosing the sentences A and B for each pretraining example, 50% of the time B is the actual\nnext sentence that follows A (labeled as IsNext),\n\nand 50% of the time it is a random sentence from\n\nthe corpus (labeled as NotNext). As we show\nin Figure 1, _C_ is used for next sentence prediction (NSP). [5] Despite its simplicity, we demonstrate in Section 5.1 that pre-training towards this\ntask is very beneficial to both QA and NLI. [6]\n\n\n5The final model achieves 97%-98% accuracy on NSP.\n6The vector _C_ is not a meaningful sentence representation\nwithout fine-tuning, since it was trained with NSP.\n\n\n![](D:/Major Project/multi-agent-multi-modal-kg/markdown_outputs/images/bidirectional_transformer.pdf-4-0.png)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: BERT input representation. The input embeddings are the sum of the token embeddings, the segmentation embeddings and the position embeddings.\n\n\n\nThe NSP task is closely related to representationlearning objectives used in Jernite et al. (2017) and\nLogeswaran and Lee (2018). However, in prior\nwork, only sentence embeddings are transferred to\ndown-stream tasks, where BERT transfers all parameters to initialize end-task model parameters.\n\n\n**Pre-training data** The pre-training procedure\nlargely follows the existing literature on language\nmodel pre-training. For the pre-training corpus we\nuse the BooksCorpus (800M words) (Zhu et al.,\n2015) and English Wikipedia (2,500M words).\nFor Wikipedia we extract only the text passages\nand ignore lists, tables, and headers. It is critical to use a document-level corpus rather than a\nshuffled sentence-level corpus such as the Billion\nWord Benchmark (Chelba et al., 2013) in order to\nextract long contiguous sequences.\n\n\n**3.2** **Fine-tuning BERT**\n\n\nFine-tuning is straightforward since the selfattention mechanism in the Transformer al\nlows BERT to model many downstream tasks\u2014\nwhether they involve single text or text pairs\u2014by\nswapping out the appropriate inputs and outputs.\nFor applications involving text pairs, a common\npattern is to independently encode text pairs before applying bidirectional cross attention, such\nas Parikh et al. (2016); Seo et al. (2017). BERT\ninstead uses the self-attention mechanism to unify\nthese two stages, as encoding a concatenated text\npair with self-attention effectively includes _bidi-_\n_rectional_ cross attention between two sentences.\n\nFor each task, we simply plug in the taskspecific inputs and outputs into BERT and finetune all the parameters end-to-end. At the input, sentence A and sentence B from pre-training\nare analogous to (1) sentence pairs in paraphrasing, (2) hypothesis-premise pairs in entailment, (3)\nquestion-passage pairs in question answering, and\n\n\n\n(4) a degenerate text-\u2205 pair in text classification\nor sequence tagging. At the output, the token representations are fed into an output layer for tokenlevel tasks, such as sequence tagging or question\nanswering, and the [CLS] representation is fed\ninto an output layer for classification, such as entailment or sentiment analysis.\nCompared to pre-training, fine-tuning is relatively inexpensive. All of the results in the paper can be replicated in at most 1 hour on a single Cloud TPU, or a few hours on a GPU, starting\nfrom the exact same pre-trained model. [7] We describe the task-specific details in the corresponding subsections of Section 4. More details can be\nfound in Appendix A.5.\n\n\n**4** **Experiments**\n\n\nIn this section, we present BERT fine-tuning results on 11 NLP tasks.\n\n\n**4.1** **GLUE**\n\n\nThe General Language Understanding Evaluation\n(GLUE) benchmark (Wang et al., 2018a) is a collection of diverse natural language understanding\ntasks. Detailed descriptions of GLUE datasets are\nincluded in Appendix B.1.\nTo fine-tune on GLUE, we represent the input\nsequence (for single sentence or sentence pairs)\nas described in Section 3, and use the final hidden vector _C \u2208_ R _[H]_ corresponding to the first\ninput token ([CLS]) as the aggregate representation. The only new parameters introduced during\nfine-tuning are classification layer weights _W \u2208_\nR _[K][\u00d7][H]_, where _K_ is the number of labels. We compute a standard classification loss with _C_ and _W_,\ni.e., log(softmax( _CW_ _[T]_ )).\n\n\n7For example, the BERT SQuAD model can be trained in\naround 30 minutes on a single Cloud TPU to achieve a Dev\nF1 score of 91.0%.\n\n8\n[See (10) in https://gluebenchmark.com/faq.](https://gluebenchmark.com/faq)\n\n\nSystem MNLI-(m/mm) QQP QNLI SST-2 CoLA STS-B MRPC RTE **Average**\n\n392k 363k 108k 67k 8.5k 5.7k 3.5k 2.5k             \nPre-OpenAI SOTA 80.6/80.1 66.1 82.3 93.2 35.0 81.0 86.0 61.7 74.0\n\nBiLSTM+ELMo+Attn 76.4/76.1 64.8 79.8 90.4 36.0 73.3 84.9 56.8 71.0", "metadata": {"source": "bidirectional_transformer_raw.md"}, "chunk_index": 2, "token_size_config": 2000}

The score of a candidate span from\nposition _i_ to position _j_ is defined as _S\u00b7Ti_ + _E\u00b7Tj_,\nand the maximum scoring span where _j \u2265_ _i_ is\nused as a prediction. The training objective is the\nsum of the log-likelihoods of the correct start and\nend positions. We fine-tune for 3 epochs with a\nlearning rate of 5e-5 and a batch size of 32.\n\nTable 2 shows top leaderboard entries as well\nas results from top published systems (Seo et al.,\n2017; Clark and Gardner, 2018; Peters et al.,\n2018a; Hu et al., 2018). The top results from the\nSQuAD leaderboard do not have up-to-date public\nsystem descriptions available, [11] and are allowed to\nuse any public data when training their systems.\nWe therefore use modest data augmentation in\nour system by first fine-tuning on TriviaQA (Joshi\net al., 2017) befor fine-tuning on SQuAD.\n\nOur best performing system outperforms the top\nleaderboard system by +1.5 F1 in ensembling and\n+1.3 F1 as a single system.

We treat questions that do not have an answer as having an answer span with start and end at the [CLS] token. The probability space for the start and end\nanswer span positions is extended to include the\nposition of the [CLS] token. For prediction, we\ncompare the score of the no-answer span: _s_ `null` =\n_S\u00b7C_ + _E\u00b7C_ to the score of the best non-null span\n\n\n12The TriviaQA data we used consists of paragraphs from\nTriviaQA-Wiki formed of the first 400 tokens in documents,\nthat contain at least one of the provided possible answers.\n\n\n\nSystem Dev Test\n\n\nESIM+GloVe 51.9 52.7\n\nESIM+ELMo 59.1 59.2\nOpenAI GPT     - 78.0\n\n\nBERTBASE 81.6     BERTLARGE **86.6 86.3**\n\n\nHuman (expert) _[\u2020]_      - 85.0\nHuman (5 annotations) _[\u2020]_      - 88.0\n\n\nTable 4: SWAG Dev and Test accuracies. _[\u2020]_ Human performance is measured with 100 samples, as reported in\nthe SWAG paper.\n\n\n\u02c6\n_si,j_ = `max` _j\u2265iS\u00b7Ti_ + _E\u00b7Tj_ .

We observe a +5.1 F1 improvement over\nthe previous best system.\n\n\n**4.4** **SWAG**\n\n\nThe Situations With Adversarial Generations\n\n(SWAG) dataset contains 113k sentence-pair completion examples that evaluate grounded commonsense inference (Zellers et al., 2018). Given a sentence, the task is to choose the most plausible continuation among four choices.\nWhen fine-tuning on the SWAG dataset, we\nconstruct four input sequences, each containing\nthe concatenation of the given sentence (sentence\nA) and a possible continuation (sentence B). The\nonly task-specific parameters introduced is a vector whose dot product with the [CLS] token representation _C_ denotes a score for each choice\n\nwhich is normalized with a softmax layer.\nWe fine-tune the model for 3 epochs with a\nlearning rate of 2e-5 and a batch size of 16. Results are presented in Table 4. BERTLARGE outperforms the authors\u2019 baseline ESIM+ELMo system by +27.1% and OpenAI GPT by 8.3%.\n\n\n**5** **Ablation Studies**\n\n\nIn this section, we perform ablation experiments\nover a number of facets of BERT in order to better\n\nunderstand their relative importance.

The left-only constraint\nwas also applied at fine-tuning, because removing\nit introduced a pre-train/fine-tune mismatch that\ndegraded downstream performance. Additionally,\nthis model was pre-trained without the NSP task.\nThis is directly comparable to OpenAI GPT, but\nusing our larger training dataset, our input representation, and our fine-tuning scheme.\n\nWe first examine the impact brought by the NSP\ntask. In Table 5, we show that removing NSP\nhurts performance significantly on QNLI, MNLI,\nand SQuAD 1.1. Next, we evaluate the impact\nof training bidirectional representations by comparing \u201cNo NSP\u201d to \u201cLTR & No NSP\u201d. The LTR\nmodel performs worse than the MLM model on all\ntasks, with large drops on MRPC and SQuAD.\n\nFor SQuAD it is intuitively clear that a LTR\nmodel will perform poorly at token predictions,\nsince the token-level hidden states have no rightside context. In order to make a good faith attempt at strengthening the LTR system, we added\na randomly initialized BiLSTM on top. This does\nsignificantly improve results on SQuAD, but the\n\n\n\nresults are still far worse than those of the pretrained bidirectional models. The BiLSTM hurts\n\nperformance on the GLUE tasks.\n\nWe recognize that it would also be possible to\ntrain separate LTR and RTL models and represent\neach token as the concatenation of the two mod\nels, as ELMo does. However: (a) this is twice as\nexpensive as a single bidirectional model; (b) this\nis non-intuitive for tasks like QA, since the RTL\n\nmodel would not be able to condition the answer\n\non the question; (c) this it is strictly less powerful\nthan a deep bidirectional model, since it can use\nboth left and right context at every layer.\n\n\n**5.2** **Effect of Model Size**\n\n\nIn this section, we explore the effect of model size\non fine-tuning task accuracy. We trained a number\nof BERT models with a differing number of layers,\nhidden units, and attention heads, while otherwise\nusing the same hyperparameters and training procedure as described previously.\n\nResults on selected GLUE tasks are shown in", "metadata": {"source": "bidirectional_transformer_raw.md"}, "chunk_index": 4, "token_size_config": 2000}

We trained a number\nof BERT models with a differing number of layers,\nhidden units, and attention heads, while otherwise\nusing the same hyperparameters and training procedure as described previously.\n\nResults on selected GLUE tasks are shown in\n\nTable 6. In this table, we report the average Dev\nSet accuracy from 5 random restarts of fine-tuning.\nWe can see that larger models lead to a strict accuracy improvement across all four datasets, even\nfor MRPC which only has 3,600 labeled training examples, and is substantially different from\nthe pre-training tasks. It is also perhaps surprising that we are able to achieve such significant\nimprovements on top of models which are already quite large relative to the existing literature.\nFor example, the largest Transformer explored in\nVaswani et al. (2017) is (L=6, H=1024, A=16)\nwith 100M parameters for the encoder, and the\nlargest Transformer we have found in the literature\nis (L=64, H=512, A=2) with 235M parameters\n(Al-Rfou et al., 2018). By contrast, BERTBASE\ncontains 110M parameters and BERTLARGE contains 340M parameters.\n\nIt has long been known that increasing the\nmodel size will lead to continual improvements\non large-scale tasks such as machine translation\nand language modeling, which is demonstrated\nby the LM perplexity of held-out training data\nshown in Table 6. However, we believe that\nthis is the first work to demonstrate convincingly that scaling to extreme model sizes also\nleads to large improvements on very small scale\ntasks, provided that the model has been sufficiently pre-trained. Peters et al. (2018b) presented\n\n\nmixed results on the downstream task impact of\nincreasing the pre-trained bi-LM size from two\nto four layers and Melamud et al. (2016) mentioned in passing that increasing hidden dimension size from 200 to 600 helped, but increasing\nfurther to 1,000 did not bring further improvements. Both of these prior works used a featurebased approach \u2014 we hypothesize that when the\nmodel is fine-tuned directly on the downstream\ntasks and uses only a very small number of randomly initialized additional parameters, the taskspecific models can benefit from the larger, more\nexpressive pre-trained representations even when\ndownstream task data is very small.\n\n\n**5.3** **Feature-based Approach with BERT**\n\n\nAll of the BERT results presented so far have used\nthe fine-tuning approach, where a simple classification layer is added to the pre-trained model, and\nall parameters are jointly fine-tuned on a downstream task. However, the feature-based approach,\nwhere fixed features are extracted from the pretrained model, has certain advantages. First, not\nall tasks can be easily represented by a Transformer encoder architecture, and therefore require\na task-specific model architecture to be added.\nSecond, there are major computational benefits\nto pre-compute an expensive representation of the\ntraining data once and then run many experiments\nwith cheaper models on top of this representation.\nIn this section, we compare the two approaches\nby applying BERT to the CoNLL-2003 Named\nEntity Recognition (NER) task (Tjong Kim Sang\nand De Meulder, 2003). In the input to BERT, we\nuse a case-preserving WordPiece model, and we\ninclude the maximal document context provided\nby the data. Following standard practice, we formulate this as a tagging task but do not use a CRF\n\n\nHyperparams Dev Set Accuracy\n\n\n#L #H #A LM (ppl) MNLI-m MRPC SST-2\n\n\n3 768 12 5.84 77.9 79.8 88.4\n\n6 768 3 5.24 80.6 82.2 90.7\n\n6 768 12 4.68 81.9 84.8 91.3\n\n12 768 12 3.99 84.4 86.7 92.9\n\n12 1024 16 3.54 85.7 86.9 93.3\n\n24 1024 16 3.23 86.6 87.8 93.7\n\n\nTable 6: Ablation over BERT model size. #L = the\n\nnumber of layers; #H = hidden size; #A = number of attention heads. \u201cLM (ppl)\u201d is the masked LM perplexity\nof held-out training data.\n\n\n\nSystem Dev F1 Test F1\n\n\nELMo (Peters et al., 2018a) 95.7 92.2\nCVT (Clark et al., 2018)  - 92.6\nCSE (Akbik et al., 2018)  - **93.1**\n\n\nFine-tuning approach\nBERTLARGE 96.6 92.8\nBERTBASE 96.4 92.4\n\n\nFeature-based approach (BERTBASE)\nEmbeddings 91.0   Second-to-Last Hidden 95.6   \nLast Hidden 94.9   Weighted Sum Last Four Hidden 95.9   Concat Last Four Hidden 96.1   Weighted Sum All 12 Layers 95.5   \n\nTable 7: CoNLL-2003 Named Entity Recognition results.

We use the representation of\nthe first sub-token as the input to the token-level\nclassifier over the NER label set.\n\n\nTo ablate the fine-tuning approach, we apply the\nfeature-based approach by extracting the activations from one or more layers _without_ fine-tuning\nany parameters of BERT. These contextual embeddings are used as input to a randomly initialized two-layer 768-dimensional BiLSTM before\nthe classification layer.\n\n\nResults are presented in Table 7. BERTLARGE\nperforms competitively with state-of-the-art methods. The best performing method concatenates the\ntoken representations from the top four hidden layers of the pre-trained Transformer, which is only\n0.3 F1 behind fine-tuning the entire model. This\ndemonstrates that BERT is effective for both finetuning and feature-based approaches.\n\n\n**6** **Conclusion**\n\n\nRecent empirical improvements due to transfer\nlearning with language models have demonstrated\nthat rich, unsupervised pre-training is an integral\npart of many language understanding systems. In\nparticular, these results enable even low-resource\ntasks to benefit from deep unidirectional architectures. Our major contribution is further generalizing these findings to deep _bidirectional_ architectures, allowing the same pre-trained model to successfully tackle a broad set of NLP tasks.\n\n\n**References**\n\n\nAlan Akbik, Duncan Blythe, and Roland Vollgraf.\n2018.

The purpose of this is to bias the\nrepresentation towards the actual observed\nword.\n\n\nThe advantage of this procedure is that the\nTransformer encoder does not know which words\n\nit will be asked to predict or which have been replaced by random words, so it is forced to keep\na distributional contextual representation of _ev-_\n_ery_ input token. Additionally, because random\nreplacement only occurs for 1.5% of all tokens\n(i.e., 10% of 15%), this does not seem to harm\nthe model\u2019s language understanding capability. In\nSection C.2, we evaluate the impact this procedure.\n\nCompared to standard langauge model training,\nthe masked LM only make predictions on 15% of\ntokens in each batch, which suggests that more\npre-training steps may be required for the model\n\n\n![](D:/Major Project/multi-agent-multi-modal-kg/markdown_outputs/images/bidirectional_transformer.pdf-12-0.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Differences in pre-training model architectures. BERT uses a bidirectional Transformer. OpenAI GPT\nuses a left-to-right Transformer. ELMo uses the concatenation of independently trained left-to-right and right-toleft LSTMs to generate features for downstream tasks. Among the three, only BERT representations are jointly\nconditioned on both left and right context in all layers. In addition to the architecture differences, BERT and\nOpenAI GPT are fine-tuning approaches, while ELMo is a feature-based approach.\n\n\n\nto converge. In Section C.1 we demonstrate that\nMLM does converge marginally slower than a leftto-right model (which predicts every token), but\nthe empirical improvements of the MLM model\nfar outweigh the increased training cost.\n\n\n**Next Sentence Prediction** The next sentence\n\nprediction task can be illustrated in the following\nexamples.\n\n\nInput = [CLS] the man went to [MASK] store [SEP]\n\n\nhe bought a gallon [MASK] milk [SEP]\n\n\nLabel = IsNext\n\n\nInput = [CLS] the man [MASK] to the store [SEP]\n\n\npenguin [MASK] are flight ##less birds [SEP]\n\n\nLabel = NotNext\n\n\n**A.2** **Pre-training Procedure**\n\n\nTo generate each training input sequence, we sample two spans of text from the corpus, which we\nrefer to as \u201csentences\u201d even though they are typically much longer than single sentences (but can\nbe shorter also). The first sentence receives the A\nembedding and the second receives the B embedding. 50% of the time B is the actual next sentence\nthat follows A and 50% of the time it is a random\n\nsentence, which is done for the \u201cnext sentence prediction\u201d task. They are sampled such that the combined length is _\u2264_ 512 tokens. The LM masking is\napplied after WordPiece tokenization with a uniform masking rate of 15%, and no special consideration given to partial word pieces.\nWe train with batch size of 256 sequences (256\nsequences * 512 tokens = 128,000 tokens/batch)\nfor 1,000,000 steps, which is approximately 40\n\n\n\nepochs over the 3.3 billion word corpus. We\nuse Adam with learning rate of 1e-4, _\u03b2_ 1 = 0 _._ 9,\n_\u03b2_ 2 = 0 _._ 999, L2 weight decay of 0 _._ 01, learning\nrate warmup over the first 10,000 steps, and linear\ndecay of the learning rate. We use a dropout probability of 0.1 on all layers. We use a gelu activation (Hendrycks and Gimpel, 2016) rather than\nthe standard relu, following OpenAI GPT. The\ntraining loss is the sum of the mean masked LM\nlikelihood and the mean next sentence prediction\nlikelihood.\n\nTraining of BERTBASE was performed on 4\nCloud TPUs in Pod configuration (16 TPU chips\ntotal). [13] Training of BERTLARGE was performed\non 16 Cloud TPUs (64 TPU chips total). Each pretraining took 4 days to complete.\nLonger sequences are disproportionately expensive because attention is quadratic to the sequence\nlength. To speed up pretraing in our experiments,\nwe pre-train the model with sequence length of\n128 for 90% of the steps. Then, we train the rest\n10% of the steps of sequence of 512 to learn the\npositional embeddings.\n\n\n**A.3** **Fine-tuning Procedure**\n\n\nFor fine-tuning, most model hyperparameters are\nthe same as in pre-training, with the exception of\nthe batch size, learning rate, and number of training epochs. The dropout probability was always\nkept at 0.1. The optimal hyperparameter values\nare task-specific, but we found the following range\nof possible values to work well across all tasks:\n\n\n  - **Batch size** : 16, 32\n\n\n13https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2018/06/CloudTPU-now-offers-preemptible-pricing-and-globalavailability.html\n\n\n  - **Learning rate (Adam)** : 5e-5, 3e-5, 2e-5\n\n  - **Number of epochs** : 2, 3, 4\n\n\nWe also observed that large data sets (e.g.,\n100k+ labeled training examples) were far less\nsensitive to hyperparameter choice than small data\nsets. Fine-tuning is typically very fast, so it is reasonable to simply run an exhaustive search over\nthe above parameters and choose the model that\nperforms best on the development set.\n\n\n**A.4** **Comparison of BERT, ELMo,and**\n**OpenAI GPT**\n\n\nHere we studies the differences in recent popular\nrepresentation learning models including ELMo,\nOpenAI GPT and BERT. The comparisons between the model architectures are shown visually\nin Figure 3. Note that in addition to the architecture differences, BERT and OpenAI GPT are finetuning approaches, while ELMo is a feature-based\napproach.\nThe most comparable existing pre-training\nmethod to BERT is OpenAI GPT, which trains a\nleft-to-right Transformer LM on a large text corpus. In fact, many of the design decisions in BERT\nwere intentionally made to make it as close to\nGPT as possible so that the two methods could be\nminimally compared. The core argument of this\nwork is that the bi-directionality and the two pretraining tasks presented in Section 3.1 account for\nthe majority of the empirical improvements, but\nwe do note that there are several other differences\n\nbetween how BERT and GPT were trained:", "metadata": {"source": "bidirectional_transformer_raw.md"}, "chunk_index": 8, "token_size_config": 2000}
