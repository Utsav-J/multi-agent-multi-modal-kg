The truth is that my collection is quite small, because so few\ninvestment books are worth keeping. To the handful that are worth reading,\none I am adding to my library is Trade Like a Stock Market Wizard by Mark\nMinervini. Mark’s book has to be on every investor’s bookshelf. It is about\nthe most comprehensive work I have ever read on investing in growth stocks\nand includes vital details not found in other popular books on that subject. Some investment books cover only the fundamental aspects of investing,\nand others cover only the technical aspects, Mark’s book combines the most\nimportant factors that could help you ﬁnd superperformance stocks in the\nfuture. Everyone wants to own the next Apple Computer, Costco, or Home\nDepot, and Mark shows you what to look for. Mark took years to research the methods that have made him successful. He has dug up gems of investing knowledge from some of the great invest-\nment books and research most investors never knew existed. For example, a\nsource he cites is Superperformance Stocks by Richard Love. When you com-\nbine that with the experience he gained through many market cycles, you\nhave a book packed with vital advice that will help any investor. In each\nchapter, Mark clearly lays out the factors that are important for a success-\nful investment. It is one of those books you have to reread to really grasp all\nthat it contains\n\nOne of the best sections of the book is Mark’s description of the life cycle\nof a growth stock. You get a fundamental and technical picture of where a\nstock is along the different phases of its move from the start in phase 1, to\n\nF O R E W O R D\n\nthe acceleration of earnings and price performance in phase 2, to the topping\nprocess in phase 3, to the trip back down in price as earnings slow in phase 4. He shows this not only with price charts but with tables of earnings and sales\nto show what is happening fundamentally as a growth stock moves over time. In the last two chapters of the book, which you should probably read\nﬁrst, Mark discusses risk management.", "char_count": 3002, "word_count": 591, "created_at": "2025-11-01T06:08:54.598310Z"}

I have always believed that to be a successful investor you have a large\ntuition bill to pay in hard losses at the University of Wall Street before you\ncan graduate and start making money. Mark supplies the best textbook on\ngrowth stock investing, and so you can avoid paying such a high tuition. With his help, a determined effort, and discipline, you can get an Ivy League\neducation for the cost of a hardcover book. If you are a seasoned inves-\ntor this book is a graduate-level class that will certainly add to your invest-\nment knowledge, as it has mine.

I’ve been trading and investing in the stock market for most of my adult\nlife: 30 years and counting as of the writing of this book. Stock trading is how\nI made my living and ultimately my fortune. Starting with only a few thou-\nsand dollars, I was able to parlay my winnings to become a multimillionaire\nby age 34. Even if I had not become rich from trading stocks, I would still\nbe doing it today. For me, trading isn’t a sport or just a way to make money;\ntrading is my life. I didn’t start out successful. In the beginning, I made the same mistakes\nevery new investor makes. However, through years of study and practice, I\ngradually acquired the necessary know-how to achieve the type of perfor-\nmance you generally only read about. I’m talking about superperformance. There’s a big difference between making a decent return in the stock mar-\nket and achieving superperformance, and that difference can be life-chang-\ning. Whether you’re an accountant, a schoolteacher, a doctor, a lawyer, a\nplumber, or even broke and unemployed as I was when I started, believe me\nyou can attain superperformance. Success  requires  opportunity. The  stock  market  provides  incredible\nopportunity on a daily basis. New companies are constantly emerging as mar-\nket leaders in every ﬁeld from high-tech medical equipment to retail stores\nand restaurants right in your own neighborhood. To spot them and take\nadvantage of their success you must have the know-how and the discipline to\napply the proper investment techniques.

Then the same people who said it couldn’t be\ndone will ask you the question they always ask me, “How did you do it?”\n\nAnd the Trade Shall Set You Free\n\nFrom the very beginning, I saw the stock market as the ultimate opportu-\nnity for ﬁnancial reward. Trading also appealed to me because I liked the\nidea of having the freedom to work at home and taking responsibility for my\nown success. In my young adult years, I had tried several different business\nventures, and even though I felt enthusiastic, that burning passion was still\nmissing. Finally, I came to realize that what I was most passionate about was\nfreedom—freedom to do what I want, when I want, where I want. One day it dawned on me: life is rich even if you’re not. I realized that\nthings were happening every day, good and bad, and that it was just a matter\n\nT R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\nof deciding what I wanted to be part of. People were getting rich in the stock\nmarket. I said to myself, Why not be part of that? I ﬁgured that if I learned\nhow to invest in the market and trade successfully, I could achieve my dream\nof ﬁnancial freedom and, more important, personal freedom. Besides, who\nwas going to hire a junior high school dropout? The stock market was the one\nplace I could see that had unlimited potential without prejudice. The author\nand successful businessman Harvey Mackay said it perfectly, “Optimists are\nright. So are pessimists. It’s up to you to choose which you will be.”\n\nAchieving the Best of  Both Worlds\n\nWhen I started trading in the early 1980s, I had only a few thousand dollars to\ninvest. I had to make huge returns on my relatively small account to survive\nand still have some trading capital left. This forced me to hone my timing and\nlearn the necessary tactics for extracting consistent proﬁts out of the stock\nmarket day in and day out. Like a pro poker player who grinds out a steady liv-\ning while consistently building a bankroll, I became a stock market “rounder.”\nMy philosophy and approach to trading is to be a conservative aggres-\nsive opportunist. Although this may seem like a contradiction in terms, it is\nnot. It simply means that my style is to be aggressive in my pursuit of poten-\ntial reward and at the same time be extremely risk-conscious. Although I\nmay invest or trade aggressively, my primary thought process begins with\n“How much can I lose?” not just “How much can I gain?”\n\nDuring my 30 years as a stock trader, I’ve discovered that a “risk-ﬁrst”\napproach is what works best for me. It has allowed me not just to perform\nor perform well but to achieve superperformance, averaging 220 percent\nper year from 1994 to 2000 (a 33,500 percent compounded total return),\nincluding a U.S. Investing Championship title in 1997. My approach also\nproved invaluable when I needed it the most: cashing me out ahead of eight\nbear markets, including two of the worst declines in U.S. stock market his-\ntory. By adhering to a disciplined strategy, I was able to accomplish the most\nimportant goal of all: to protect my trading account and keep the proﬁts I\nmade during the previous bull markets.

What kept me going? Unconditional persistence. When you make an unshakable commitment\nto a way of life, you put yourself way ahead of most others in the race for\nsuccess. Why? Because most people have a natural tendency to overestimate\nwhat they can achieve in the short run and underestimate what they can\naccomplish over the long haul. They think they’ve made a commitment, but\nwhen they run into difﬁculty, they lose steam or quit. Most people get interested in trading but few make a real commitment. The difference between interest and commitment is the will not to give up. When you truly commit to something, you have no alternative but suc-\ncess. Getting interested will get you started, but commitment gets you to\nthe ﬁnish line. The ﬁrst and best investment you can make is an investment\nin yourself, a commitment to do what it takes and to persist. Persistence is\nmore important than knowledge. You must persevere if you wish to succeed\nin anything. Knowledge and skill can be acquired through study and prac-\ntice, but nothing great comes to those who quit. When Opportunity Meets Prepardness\n\nWhen people hear my success story, the two questions they ask most often\nare, How did you do it? and Did you just get lucky? The assumption is that I\nmust have taken a lot of big risks or been lucky along the way. So how did I do it? For years I worked on perfecting my trading skills, plugging away 70 to\n80 hours a week, often staying up to pore over stock charts and company\nﬁnancials until the sun came up the next day. Even though the results weren’t\nthere yet, I persevered. I spent years separating the proverbial wheat from the\nchaff, perfecting my process by analyzing my successes and, more impor-\ntant, my failures. I invested countless hours in learning how great investors\n\nT R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\napproached the market and how they created and executed trading strate-\ngies and developed the emotional discipline required to follow their models. Then something wonderful happened. My preparation intersected with\nopportunity. I had been honing my skills for years, and by 1990 I was fully\nequipped to take advantage of a new emerging bull market. With all the les-\nsons I had learned from my trial-and-error days in the 1980s, the pitch was\nnow coming across the plate, and I was staring at my chance to knock the\nball out of the park. I was 100 percent prepared, like an Olympic athlete who\nhas practiced and practiced and is now ready to perform with perfection. Opportunities in the stock market can spring to life on short notice.

Similarly, I would like others to beneﬁt from and fur-\nther advance my work. The stock market provides the greatest opportunity on earth for ﬁnan-\ncial reward. It also teaches great lessons to those who win and those who\nlose, an education that goes well beyond trading and investing. Without a\ndoubt, the stock market gives you incredible exhilaration when you win and\ndeep humility when you lose. It is the greatest game on earth, and for me it\nhas proved to be the greatest business opportunity on earth. To realize proﬁts from investing in stocks, you must make three correct\ndecisions: what to buy, when to buy, and when to sell.

Armed with this valuable knowledge, I\ntrust you too will enjoy success in the stock market and pass the torch again. Most of the examples in this book involve stocks that I traded for myself\nbetween 1984 and 2012. This is road-tested research that is very near and\ndear to me.

C H A P T E R   2\n\nWhat You Need\n\nto Know First\n\nThere isn’t a person anywhere who isn’t capable of doing more than\n\nhe thinks he can. —Henry Ford\n\nM any people hope to achieve great success in the stock market,\n\nbut few actually do. Over time the average investor realizes only\nmediocre or inconsistent results at best. The reason for this lack of success is\nsimply that most investors have not taken the time to study and understand\nwhat really works in the stock market and what actually accounts for super-\nperformance. The vast majority of investors operate from faulty assump-\ntions that are based on personal opinion or theory, not unbiased facts. Only\na fraction of stock traders have made the effort to carefully study the char-\nacteristics and behavior patterns of superperformance stocks. Among those\nwho acquire the necessary knowledge, many fail to develop the emotional\ndiscipline to execute a winning plan. What is the underlying reason so many people fall short of achieving\ntheir goals and fail to have big success in the stock market? Largely, it boils\ndown to the fact that few individuals truly believe they can achieve super-\nperformance in stocks. They’ve been told that a big return entails big risks or\nthat if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\nLet me assure you that you can achieve superperformance in stocks if\nyou so desire and that it does not have to be a high-risk endeavor. It’s not\ngoing to happen overnight, and you will most likely have to learn to do cer-\ntain things that go against your natural instincts or perhaps relearn some\ningrained investment beliefs. However, with the right tools and the right\nattitude, anyone can do it if he or she chooses. No Luck Required\n\nThe more I practice, the luckier I get. —Gary Player\n\nAchieving superperformance in stocks is not a function of luck or even cir-\ncumstance. Contrary to what many believe, it is not gambling either. As with\nany great achievement, superperformance is attained through knowledge,\npersistence, and skill, which is acquired over time through dedication and\nhard work. Most of all, long-term success in the stock market comes from dis-\ncipline, the ability to consistently execute a sound plan and refrain from self-\ndefeating behavior. If you have these traits, the odds are that you will succeed. With gambling, in contrast, the odds are stacked against you. If you play\nenough, you will deﬁnitely lose. If you think stock trading is gambling, I sup-\npose you could say the same thing about brain surgery (it certainly would\nbe a gamble if I were performing the operation). To a trained surgeon with\nthe necessary expertise, though, it is a job with risks that are offset by knowl-\nedge, training, and ultimately skill. Stock trading is no different. Success in the stock market has little to do with luck. On the contrary,\n\nthe more you work a sound plan, the luckier you will become.", "char_count": 4891, "word_count": 879, "created_at": "2025-11-01T06:08:54.599310Z"}

Do You Want to Be Right or Make Money? After my biotech ﬁasco with the full-service broker, I decided to take mat-\nters into my own hands. I opened a trading account at a discount house\nwhere I met a broker named Ron. Over the course of a couple of years, Ron\nand I became pretty close friends; we had certain things in common, but it\ncertainly wasn’t evident in our trading styles. He was sort of a value buyer\nwho wasn’t concerned about supply and demand or price trends. My style,\nin contrast, was to buy new, relatively unknown companies on the rise. I\ndemanded that they be in a price uptrend, and if they went down much\nbelow my purchase price, I would sell them. At least that was the plan. As Ron and I watched each other’s trades, our favorite sport became\ngiving the other guy a hard time when one of his stocks tanked. Sometimes\nI’d hit a few losers in row, and Ron would razz me: “Hey, genius, what hap-\npened? That one sure went down the toilet!” The verbal jabs really got to me. Sometimes I held on to losing stocks because I couldn’t stand the thought of\nthe ridicule awaiting me when I phoned in a sell order to Ron. A stock would fall 5 percent and then 10 percent, and I knew I should\nsell. Then I’d think of Ron and hold on to that dog while it fell 15 percent\nand then 20 percent. The bigger the loss was, the harder it became to call\nRon and place the sell order. Even if he didn’t say a word to me, I felt humili-\nated. Meanwhile, the stock continued to suck money out of my account like\na rupture in the hull of a ship. Both opportunities and perils surface suddenly in the market. It takes\nswift,  resolute  action  to  exploit  one  and  elude  the  other.

It wasn’t\nuntil I suffered enough big losses that I made the decision that turned\nmy performance from mediocre to stellar: I decided it was time to make\nmoney and stop stressing about my ego. I began selling off losing stocks\nquickly, which meant taking small losses but preserving the lion’s share of\nmy hard-earned capital. Almost overnight, I regained a feeling of control. That new approach also freed me to take an objective look at my perfor-\nmance. In the past, I’d tried to forget about my losing stocks. Now I was ana-\nlyzing my losers and learning from them. I saw my portfolio with fresh eyes\nand ﬁnally began to understand that trading is not about picking highs and\nlows or proving how smart you are; trading is about making money. If you\nwant to reap big gains in the market, make up your mind right now that you\nare going to separate trading from your ego. It’s more important to make\nmoney than it is to be right.

Trading Is a Business\n\nMany people have the misconception that stock trading is a mysterious\nendeavor that is governed by a set of laws different from those for an ordi-\nnary business. Trading stocks and running a business are virtually identical. In fact, to be successful, you must trade just as if you were running a busi-\nness. As an investor, your merchandise is stocks. Your objective is to buy\nshares that are in strong demand and sell them at a higher price. How much\nof a proﬁt margin you make will depend a lot on the type of business (port-\nfolio) you are running. You may be like Walmart, which operates on very\nsmall margins but does a tremendous amount of volume with high inventory\nturnover. Or you may be like a boutique that offers unique and trendy mer-\nchandise and earns higher margins but does much lower volume. You may\nbe making numerous trades for a small gain, but by sheer volume you turn in\nan impressive return at the end of the year. Or you may be a long-term inves-\ntor with select merchandise that also produces a solid return. In the end, it all comes down to having your gains on average be larger\nthan your losses, nailing down a proﬁt, and repeating the process. This is\nthe basic objective of any business endeavor. Most investors treat trading as\na hobby because they have a full-time job doing something else. However,\nif you treat trading like a business, it will pay you like a business. If you treat\n\nT R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\ntrading like a hobby, it will pay you like a hobby, and hobbies don’t pay;\nthey cost you. Don’t Invest Like a Fund Manager\n\nThe amateur investor has many built in advantages that could result\n\nin outperforming the experts. Rule #1 is to stop listening to the\n\nprofessionals. —Peter Lynch\n\nAs a stock trader in search of superperformance, not only should you\nnot listen to most professionals, you should not invest the way they do. If\nyou’re going to invest like a fund manager, why not just give your money\nto a fund manager? This will achieve essentially the same result without the\nwork. Better yet, why not just invest in stock market index funds, which\nbeat most fund managers? The fact is that to outpace their peers, most big\nfund managers need to learn how to invest less like fund managers and\nmore like superperformance traders. Most big funds are doomed to medi-\nocrity by design. Individuals, however, have a big advantage over these\ninstitutional investors. Contrary to what many believe, a professional money manager has no\nadvantage over an individual investor. Many big institutions utilize ﬂawed\nprinciples that are based on personal opinion, tradition, and ego as well as,\nin many cases, pure ignorance. The biggest handicap facing virtually every\nbig fund manager is size. First and foremost, institutional investors need\nliquidity to handle the large blocks of shares they must buy to add positions\nthat will have a meaningful impact on their portfolios. This forces big play-\ners to pick companies with relatively large amounts of shares outstanding. This is the exact opposite of what we know to be a key factor for superper-\nformance: a relatively small number of shares in the ﬂoat. Big institutions have a difﬁcult time taking a position in a company\nwith a small number of shares outstanding. Even if they can, the real prob-\nlem comes later, when it’s time to sell the stock in a falling market. When\nforced to liquidate a large position, an institution risks precipitating a fur-\n\n\fC H A P T E R   2   W H A T   Y O U   N E E D   T O   K N O W   F I R S T\n\nther plunge in the stock’s share price as a result of the fund’s large block sell-\ning activity. An individual investor, however, can move quickly and respond\nin an instant during both entry and exit, taking advantage of the best high-\ngrowth situations available early on and then stepping aside when necessary. Another drawback is that many big fund managers can invest only in\nshares from a committee-approved list. Managers meet with these commit-\ntees to justify buy and sell decisions. A dreadful situation for a manager is\nhaving to explain a position gone disastrously wrong in a small, presumably\nrisky situation even though the company showed great growth prospects. A\nsafer bet with better job security is for that manager to buy larger, seemingly\nsafe plays such as IBM and Apple. Then, if something goes wrong, the entire\nmarket most likely is suffering, and the losses can be attributed to the overall\nenvironment. At the very least, the manager’s reputation is insulated by the\nfact that he or she bought “quality.” As the old Wall Street saying goes, “You\nwill never lose your job losing your clients’ money in IBM.”\n\nInstitutions generally need to stay invested in portfolios that are diversi-\nﬁed across many individual stocks and industries. This is primarily a result\nof their need for liquidity and the belief that spreading risk over many names\nwill reduce the risk in any one name.", "char_count": 5657, "word_count": 1015, "created_at": "2025-11-01T06:08:54.599310Z"}

If fund managers fall behind their benchmark averages\nfor any length of time, investors will jump ship, and the managers could lose\ntheir jobs. Individuals, in contrast, can react to surprises that create new price\ntrends almost instantly. There is no committee approval process and no\ndiversiﬁcation mandate. With today’s technology, most traders—profes-\nsional and individual alike—have nearly identical tools at their disposal. However, individual traders have a tremendous advantage over profession-\nals mainly because they have greater liquidity and speed, enabling them to\nbe more concentrated in a small list of well-selected names at even lower\nrisk because an individual can utilize stop-loss protection with little or no\nslippage.

Most big institutions would rather make what they regard as safe invest-\nments than pursue big capital gains. They will boast about success if the\nmarket is down 40 percent but their portfolio has lost only, say, 32 percent. That’s an example of what they claim is beating the market! If you think for\na minute that the big institutional approach is safer or less risky, I suggest\nyou take a look at your favorite mutual funds and study their performance\nduring past major bear markets. For a big fund manager, size impairs precision: the ability to enter and\nexit stock positions without affecting price in a counterproductive way. This\ntechnical disadvantage forces the manager to seek informational superior-\nity. Although tactics and techniques play a role for virtually every investor,\nthe individual can utilize a tactical approach with far greater efﬁciency and\neffectiveness than can the large institutional player. The bottom line is that if you want mutual fund–like results, invest like\na fund manager. If you want superperformance results, you must invest like\na superperformance investor.

Although I have taken the information in, reﬁned it, and retooled it into\nmy own Speciﬁc Entry Point Analysis, or SEPA, to suit my own trading, I am\nindebted to the market masters whose groundbreaking works go back many\ndecades. An eye-opening book for me was Richard Love’s Superperformance\nStocks. Although much of the book was about the political cycle, I was\nintrigued by Chapter 7, which focused on the commonalities of big win-\nning stocks. Love’s studies from 1962 to 1976 focused on the characteristics\nof stocks that went up a minimum of 300 percent in a two-year period; he\ncalled them superperformance stocks. Although Love’s approach caught my attention, initially I wasn’t sure\nexactly how to use it in my own trading, and so the information stayed\ntucked away in my mind unused while I continued my quest to learn more. In 1988, I read an article in the March–April issue of Financial Analyst\nJournal titled “The Anatomy of a Stock Market Winner.” The article dis-\ncussed the ﬁndings from a study of superior securities: stocks that went\nup a minimum of 100 percent in a calendar year. The author, Marc R. Reinganum, had explored the 222 stock market winners from 1970 to 1983\nto determine what contributed to their superior performance. As I read the article, the proverbial bell went off in my head and I\nrecalled Love’s book. For one thing, there was a partial overlap between the\ntime frames studied by Love and Reinganum. Furthermore, the purposes\nof their studies were almost identical: focusing on stocks that had made the\nbiggest gains to identify the characteristics that accounted for their stellar\nperformance.

As\nI cross-referenced the two, my conﬁdence increased that this approach\n(known as reverse factor modeling) had merit and that there was a possibil-\nity I could use it in a methodical fashion to ﬁnd big stock winners. It made\nintuitive sense to me: studying the best to ﬁnd the best. Studying Love’s work set me on a course to learn what makes a stock\nmove up dramatically in price to join the elite circle of superperformers. This ultimately became my life’s work. Love’s ﬁndings convinced me of\nthree empowering points:\n\n1. There is a right time and a wrong time to buy stocks. 2. Stocks with superperformance potential are identiﬁable before\n\nthey increase dramatically in price. 3. By correctly investing in these stocks, it is possible to build a small\n\namount of capital into a fortune in a relatively short period. The Melting Pot\n\nOver the course of my trading career, in addition to Richard Love’s book,\nthe works of others have inspired me. Among them was The Relative Strength\nConcept of Common Stock Price Forecasting by Robert A. Levy, which helped\nme banish the “buy weakness” mentality and was instrumental in my new\napproach of focusing on strength. Then there was Edward S. Jensen’s Stock\nMarket Blueprints, published in 1967. Jensen’s book included his blueprints\nfor each type of stock, which were based on criteria such as income, growth,\ncyclical growth, and dynamic growth. What I liked about Jensen was that he,\nlike Love, proceeded from an objective study of stocks to create templates\nfrom factor models. This rigorous approach inspired me to create my own\nLeadership Proﬁle®. Another inﬂuence was Richard Donchian, who was born in Hartford,\nConnecticut; graduated from Yale with a degree in economics; and went\nto work on Wall Street in the 1930s. Donchian is considered the creator of\n\nT R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\nthe managed futures industry. He developed a rule-based trading approach\nthat became known as trend following. Among his principles was the buying\nand selling of stocks when the 5-period moving average crossed above and\nbelow the 20-period moving average. It was Donchian’s work that inﬂu-\nenced me to add certain trend elements to my model for qualifying trades\nand timing entries. Later I came across William L. Jiler, who did extensive work in chart pat-\nterns. In his book, Jiler acknowledged the contribution of Donchian, who at\nthe time was director of commodity research at the securities ﬁrm Hayden\nStone. These men became my professors as I meticulously studied the mar-\nket. From Love, I learned historical precedent analysis and the common-\nalities of superperformance stocks; from Jensen, blueprinting and proﬁling;\nfrom Donchian, trend following; and from Jiler, chart patterns, including his\nfamous saucer with platform, which is now known as the cup-and-handle\npattern, popularized by William O’Neil, who also worked at Hayden Stone\nin the 1960s. Of  course,  the  master  of  them  all  was  Jesse  Livermore,  the  great-\nest trader ever. In 1907, he made $3 million in a single day. While most\ninvestors were devastated during the great crash of 1929, Livermore made\na whopping $100 million shorting the market. For me, this was incred-\nibly inspiring. Although most people associate Livermore with the book\nReminiscences of a Stock Operator, I gravitated to his pragmatic work How\nto Trade in Stocks. Reading Livermore’s book crystallized my thoughts. Many of the principles that were starting to work for me seemed no differ-\nent from those that had worked for Livermore back in the ﬁrst decades of\nthe twentieth century. From one market professor to the next, the lessons were consistent and\nclear. The basics of what made a superperformance stock in the past had not\nchanged appreciably. No matter how the economy evolved or which indus-\ntries emerged, the basic criteria for superperformance were constant. Many\npeople before me had come to the same conclusion.", "char_count": 4097, "word_count": 690, "created_at": "2025-11-01T06:08:54.600308Z"}

Now I could conduct quantitative analysis: tracking and\nstudying more big winners and observing stocks in real time to conﬁrm his-\ntorical ﬁndings in a modern time frame. The computer also allowed me to\nscreen thousands of potential companies on the basis of superperformance\ncharacteristics. Before this, I was ﬁnding and tracking stocks manually, which\nas you might guess placed a severe limitation on how many I could cover. Early\non, I even created my stock charts by hand on graph paper daily. What a chore! As I studied and traded stocks in real time, the data I collected and the\nresults I produced agreed with Love and Reinganum’s conclusions. Up to\nthis point, I had not developed a speciﬁc formula for trading, but I was hom-\ning in on the characteristics of superperformance stocks and  starting to have\nsome meaningful success by trading on those insights for my own account. Putting the Findings to Work\n\nThe boom in technology, consumer retailing, and healthcare in the early\n1990s transformed obscure companies into household names. Utilizing\nwhat I had learned during the 1980s, I was able to catch some big movers as\nstocks transitioned from the 1990 bear market into a new bull market. US\nSurgical, Amgen, American Power Conversion, Ballard Medical Products,\nUS Healthcare, Surgical Care Afﬁliates, Medco Containment, Microsoft,\nHome Depot, Dell Computer, International Game Technology, and Cisco\nSystems were at that time relatively unknown names that displayed strong\nfundamental and technical characteristics. Many investors missed these\ngreat companies during their phenomenal growth phases because of their\nrelatively high price/earnings (P/E) ratios. In 1991, the 40 top-performing\nstocks (starting at above $12 a share) began the year with an average P/E of\n29, and by year end their P/E ratios had expanded to 83. T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\nThe Leadership Profile\n\nBy using almost three decades of actual trading and meticulous accumula-\ntion of historical data from as far back as the late 1800s, I’ve constructed a\nblueprint of the characteristics shared by superperformance stocks. I call\nthis a Leadership Proﬁle, which is an ongoing effort to identify in detail the\nqualities and attributes of the most successful stocks of the past to determine\nwhat makes a stock likely to dramatically outperform its peers in the future. The focus is not just on the magnitude of a price move—how much a stock\ngoes up—but also on the time element of the equation: how fast it goes up\nand what accounts for the rapid rise. In the stock market, timing is cru-\ncial because time is money. When screening my database, I compare each\nstock candidate to how well it ﬁts the optimal Leadership Proﬁle and rank\nit accordingly. The result is a dramatic increase in the probability of ﬁnding\nthe next superperformer. SEPA: A Strategy of  Precision\n\nHoning my timing for entries and exits has been a major focus for me. Over the years, my SEPA methodology evolved into a strategy that has been\nreferred to by some as trading with surgical precision. The SEPA approach,\nwhich I will explain in detail, allows me to ﬁnd those elite candidates that\nhave the potential to become superperformers. The objective of SEPA is to\ntake all the pertinent information available and pinpoint the precise spot at\nwhich to enter a high-probability trade in terms of risk versus reward. SEPA\ncombines corporate fundamentals with the technical behavior of a stock. The underlying criteria of SEPA are derived from rigorous research, decades\nof application in the real world, and observed facts, not personal opinions\nor academic theories. The Five Key Elements of  SEPA\n\nThe basic characteristics are broken down into ﬁve major categories, which\nmake up the key foundational building blocks of the SEPA methodology:\n\n1.

In almost every case, the trend was identiﬁable early in\nthe superperformance advance. 2. Fundamentals. Most superperformance phases are driven by an\nimprovement in earnings, revenue, and margins. This typically\nmaterializes before the start of the superperformance phase. In\nmost cases, earnings and sales are on the table and measurable\nearly on. During a stock’s superperformance phase, a material\nimprovement almost always occurs in the fundamental picture\nwith regard to sales, margins, and, ultimately, earnings. 3. Catalyst. Every stock that makes a huge gain has a catalyst behind\nit. The catalyst may not always be apparent upon a casual glance,\nbut a little detective work on the company’s story could tip you\noff to a stock with superperformance potential. A new hot-selling\nproduct that accounts for a meaningful portion of a company’s\nsales may provide the spark to ignite a superperformance phase\nin that company’s stock price. Approval by the FDA, a newly\nawarded contract, or even a new CEO can bring life to a previously\ndormant stock. In dealing with small, lesser-known names, it\noften takes some event to attract attention to a stock. I like to see\nsomething that gets investors excited. Examples would include\nApple (AAPL) reaching cult status with its Mac and “I” products,\nResearch in Motion (RIMM) with its BlackBerry (so habit-\nforming for Internet and e-mail junkies that it’s been nicknamed\nCrackBerry), and Google (GOOG), which became so synonymous\nwith Internet search engines that it made it into the dictionary\nas a verb. Each situation may be somewhat different whether\nthe stock is a classic growth company, a turnaround situation, a\ncyclical stock, or a biotech trading on the promise of a new drug. Whatever the reason, behind all superperformance there is always\na catalyst driving institutional interest. 4. Entry points. Most superperformance stocks give you at least one\nopportunity and sometimes multiple opportunities to catch a\nmeteoric rise at a low-risk entry point. Timing the entry point is\n\nT R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\ncritical. Time your entry incorrectly and you will be stopped out\nunnecessarily or lose big if the stock turns around and you fail to\nsell. Time the entry correctly during a bull market and you could\nbe at a proﬁt right away and on your way to a big gain. 5. Exit points. Not all stocks that display superperformance\n\ncharacteristics will result in gains. Many will not work out even\nif you place your buys at the correct point. This is why you must\nestablish stop-loss points to force you out of losing positions\nto protect your account. Conversely, at some point your stock\nmust be sold to realize a proﬁt.", "char_count": 2916, "word_count": 515, "created_at": "2025-11-01T06:08:54.600308Z"}

To accomplish this, I take\ninto account all the relevant fundamental, technical, and market factors and\npinpoint the position at which there is a supportive convergence. I execute\na trade only at the point of alignment across the spectrum with regard to\ncompany fundamentals, stock price, and volume activity as well as overall\nmarket conditions. I want to see these factors converge like four cars arriv-\ning at the same time at a four-way intersection. The SEPA method stacks\nsupporting probabilities to produce that alignment. Virtually every big winning stock exhibits very speciﬁc and measur-\nable criteria before making its big moves. In their superperformance days,\nthese stocks have distinguishing characteristics—whether a new product, an\ninnovative service, or some kind of fundamental change—that enables the\ncompany to make money at a superior or accelerated rate and in some cases\nfor an extended period. As a result, the shares of these companies experi-\nence signiﬁcant price appreciation by attracting institutional buying. You\ndon’t have to know everything about a company or the market; however,\nyou need to know the right things. By putting all these elements together—\nfundamental,  technical,  qualitative,  and  market  tone—and  demanding\nthat stocks be able to cross multiple hurdles, you will be far more likely to\nidentify something exceptional. The collective value of these parameters is\ngreater than the sum of their parts. Superperformance Traits\n\nOver the years, I’ve concluded that most superperformance stocks have\ncommon identiﬁable characteristics. In the majority of cases, decent earn-\nings were already on the table. In fact, the majority of superperformance\nstocks already had periods of outperformance in terms of fundamentals\nas well as technical action before they made their biggest gains. More than\n90 percent of superperformance stocks began their phenomenal price\nsurges as the general market came out of a correction or bear market. Interestingly, very few stocks had superperformance phases during a bear\nmarket. C H A P T E R   3   S P E C I F I C   E N T R Y   P O I N T   A N A LY S I S\n\nSuperperformers Are Youthful\n\nGenerally, a superperformance phase occurs when a stock is relatively young,\nfor example, during the ﬁrst 10 years after the initial public offering (IPO). Many superperformers were private companies for many years before going\npublic, and when they ﬁnally did, they had a proven track record of earnings\nand growth. Some superperformance companies already established suc-\ncessful product lines and brands before coming public. During the bear market correction of the early 1990s, I focused on\nstocks that were holding up well and then moved into new high ground ﬁrst\noff the market’s low. Most of the names I traded were relatively unknown\nat the time. These stocks were propelled by characteristics such as big earn-\nings growth and strong product demand. One example was US Surgical,\nwhich pioneered products such as the surgical staple and laparoscopic sur-\ngery. Software, computer peripheral, and technology-related stocks also\nperformed well during that period, fueled by the boom in personal com-\nputing. Most investors shy away from names they have never heard of. This\nis exactly the opposite of what you should do if your goal is to ﬁnd big stock\nmarket winners. Size Matters\n\nMost companies have their high-growth phase when they’re relatively\nsmall  and  nimble. As  they  grow  older,  larger,  and  more  mature,  their\ngrowth begins to slow, as does the rate at which their stock prices appre-\nciate. Superperformance stocks are often small-cap companies, although\noccasionally a big-cap name could see a surge in price after a turnaround\nor a period of depressed stock prices resulting from a bear market. Most of\nthe time, however, it is a small-cap or a mid-cap stock that hits a period of\naccelerated growth, which in turn creates a superperformance price phase. Investors interested in superperformance should keep a constant look-\nout for small to medium-size companies in the growth stage of their life\ncycle (accelerating earning and sales). On balance, the growth of earnings\n\nT R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\nand sales and, more important, the stock price is usually more rapid for a\nsmall to medium-size company than for a larger, mature company. Large\ncompanies usually have proven track records of execution. With smaller\ncompanies it’s important in most cases to conﬁrm that they’re already\nproﬁtable and have proved that their business model can be scaled and\nduplicated. Look for candidates with a relatively small total market capitaliza-\ntion and amount of shares outstanding. All things being equal, a small-\ncap company will have the potential to appreciate more than a large-cap,\nbased on the supply of stock available. It will take far less demand to move\nthe stock of a small company with a comparatively small share ﬂoat than\na large-cap candidate. This realization can also help you develop realistic expectations about\nthe proﬁt side of the equation. Large-cap companies are not going to make\nlarge-scale price advances the way a younger, smaller company will. There\nare times when a big-cap stock will be depressed because of a bear market\nor a temporary economic hardship, which may provide the opportunity to\nbuy a company such as Coca-Cola or American Express or Walmart at the\nbeginning of a decent price move as it recovers.", "char_count": 7049, "word_count": 1151, "created_at": "2025-11-01T06:08:54.600308Z"}

Stock Screening\n\nSince the 1980s, I have been using computer assisted screening as a way to\nnarrow down a tremendous amount of information—as many as 10,000\nstocks daily—to produce a manageable list of candidates that meet some\nminimum criteria to be studied further. Today, there are many screening\ntools available for the investor. Here are a few suggestions on screening. When  you  are  conducting  quantitative  analysis  (stock  screening),\nkeeping it simple will serve you better than using a complicated model. You\n\n\fC H A P T E R   3   S P E C I F I C   E N T R Y   P O I N T   A N A LY S I S\n\nmust be careful not to put too much into each screen. Otherwise, you may\ninadvertently eliminate good candidates that meet all your criteria except\nfor one. For example, let’s say you want to select stocks that exhibit a cer-\ntain level of earnings, market cap, estimate revisions, and so forth, until\nyou have 12 lines of criteria. If a stock meets 11 but misses by a hair on the\ntwelfth, you will never see that stock. Remember, if you have 100 items in\nyour criteria, a stock needs to miss only 1 to be ﬁltered out even though the\nother 99 are met. A better approach is to run separate screens that are based on smaller\nlists of compatible criteria, for example, one screen for relative price strength\nand trend and a separate fundamental screen that is based on earnings and\nsales. Often, as you run isolated screens, you will see some of the same names\nrecurring, whereas a few names will appear on only one list. Remember,\ncomputers are great for weeding out noise and pointing your research in\nthe right direction; however, if you want consistent superperformance, you\nwill need to roll up your sleeves and do some old-fashioned manual analy-\nsis. That’s the interesting part of trading, and that’s what makes it fun and\nrewarding. Make a Commitment to an Approach\n\nYou don’t need a PhD in math or physics to be successful in the stock mar-\nket, just the right knowledge, a good work ethic, and discipline. The SEPA\nmethodology was developed after decades of searching, testing, and going\nback to the drawing board countless times to uncover what actually works. It has been time-tested and proved effective in the real world with real\nresults. You, too, will go through your own trial-and-error period: win-\ndow-shopping and trying various concepts and approaches to the stock\nmarket, whether value, growth, fundamental, technical, or some combi-\nnation. In the end, to succeed, you will need to settle on an approach that\nmakes sense to you. Most important, you must commit to perfecting and\nreﬁning your understanding of that methodology and its execution. A\nstock trading strategy is like a marriage; if you’re not faithful, you probably\n\nT R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\nwon’t have a good outcome. It takes time and dedication, but your objec-\ntive should be to become a specialist in your approach to the market. Although strategy is important, it’s not as critical as knowledge and the\ndiscipline to apply and adhere to your rules. A trader who really knows the\nstrengths and weaknesses of his or her strategy can do signiﬁcantly better\nthan someone who knows only a little about a superior strategy. Of course,\nthe ideal situation would be to know a lot about a great strategy. That should\nbe your ultimate goal. C H A P T E R   4\n\nValue Comes at a Price\n\nIt’s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair\n\ncompany at a wonderful price. —Warren Buffett\n\nW hen you think of value in the traditional sense, bargains\n\nimmediately spring to mind: something once priced higher\nnow is priced lower. It seems logical. Growth stock investing, however, can\nturn this deﬁnition on its head. In the stock market, what appears cheap\ncould actually be expensive and what looks expensive or too high may turn\nout to be the next superperformance stock. The simple reality is that value\ncomes at a price. The P/E Ratio: Overused and Misunderstood\n\nEvery day, armies of analysts and Wall Street pros churn out thousands\nof opinions about stock values. This stock is overvalued; that one is a bar-\ngain. What is the basis of many of these valuation calls? Often it’s the price/\nearnings ratio (P/E), a stock’s price expressed as a multiple of the compa-\nny’s earnings. A great amount of incorrect information has been written\nabout the P/E ratio. Many investors rely too heavily on this popular formula\nbecause of a misunderstanding or a lack of knowledge. Although it may\ncome as a surprise to you, historical analyses of superperformance stocks\nsuggest that by themselves P/E ratios rank among of the most useless sta-\ntistics on Wall Street. T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\nThe standard P/E ratio reﬂects historical results and does not take into\naccount the most important element for stock price appreciation: the future. Sure, it’s possible to use earnings estimates to calculate a forward-looking\nP/E ratio, but if you do, you’re relying on estimates that are opinions and\noften turn out to be wrong. If a company reports disappointing earnings\nthat fail to meet or beat the estimates, analysts will revise their earnings pro-\njections downward. As a result, the forward-looking denominator—the E in\nP/E—will shrink, and assuming the P remains constant, the ratio will rise. This is why it’s important to concentrate on companies that are reporting\nstrong earnings, which then trigger upward revisions in earnings estimates. Strong earnings growth will make a stock a better value. Bottom Fishers’ Bliss\n\nSome analysts will recommend that you buy a stock that has had a severe\ndecline. The justiﬁcation may be that the P/E is at or near the low end of its\nhistorical range. In many instances, however, such price adjustments antici-\n\nFigure 4.1  American Intl Group (AIG) 1999–2000\n\n\fC H A P T E R   4   V A L U E   C O M E S   A T   A   P R I C E\n\npate poor earnings reports. When quarterly results are ﬁnally released and\na company misses analysts’ estimates or reports a loss, the P/E moves back\nup (in some cases it skyrockets), which may cause the stock price to adjust\ndownward even further. This was the case for Morgan Stanley (MS/NYSE)\nin late 2007. The stock price fell and drove the P/E to a 10-year low. Morgan\nlater reported disappointing negative year-over-year earnings comparisons,\nand the P/E ratio promptly soared to more than 120 times earnings. With\nearnings deteriorating and the stock selling at a P/E of 120, the stock was\nsuddenly severely overvalued. The share price plunged even further to under\n$7. The cause of Morgan Stanley’s decline was an industrywide ﬁnancial cri-\nsis, and by 2008 the P/E ratios of Bank America, Citigroup, and AIG all hit\n10-year lows, along with those of many others in the banking and ﬁnancial\nsector. Within 12 months, all three stocks plunged more than 90 percent. The Cheap Trap\n\nBuying a cheap stock is like a trap hand in poker; it’s hard to get away from. When you buy a stock solely because it’s cheap, it’s difﬁcult to sell if it moves\nagainst you because then it’s even cheaper, which is the reason you bought it\nin the ﬁrst place. The cheaper it gets, the more attractive it becomes based on\nthe “it’s cheap” rationale. This is the type of thinking that gets investors in\nbig trouble.", "char_count": 7603, "word_count": 1358, "created_at": "2025-11-01T06:08:54.600308Z"}

Many superperformance stocks tend to move to extreme valua-\ntions and leave analysts in awe as their prices continue to climb into the\nstratosphere in spite of what appears to be a ridiculous valuation. Missing\nout on these great companies is due to misunderstanding the way Wall Street\nworks and therefore concentrating on the wrong price drivers.

Every institutional investor I\nmentioned the stock to said, “No way—Ya-WHO?” The company was vir-\ntually unknown at the time, but Yahoo! was leading a new technological\nrevolution: the Internet. The potential for what was then a new industry\nwas widely misunderstood at the time. Yahoo! shares advanced an amazing\n7,800 percent in just 29 months, and the P/E expanded to more than 1,700\ntimes earnings.

There’s a Reason a Ferrari\nCosts More Than a Hyundai\n\nIf you want to buy a high-performance car such as a Ferrari, you’re going to\npay a premium price. The same thing applies to high-performance stocks. The top 100 best-performing small- and mid-cap stocks of 1996 and 1997\nhad an average P/E of 40. Their P/Es grew further to an average of 87 and\na median of 65. Relatively speaking, their initially “expensive” P/Es turned\nout to be extremely cheap.

They won’t touch a stock whose P/E is much higher than,\nsay, that of the S&P 500 index. Savvy growth players know that you often\nhave to pay more for the best goods in the market. Consider the example\nof CKE Restaurants, which sported a relatively high P/E just before the\nstock price took off. CKE Restaurants emerged into new high ground in\nextremely fast trading on October 13, 1995. Right before its breakout, the\nstock had a P/E of 55, or 2.9 times the S&P’s P/E of 18.9. The company had\nscored triple-digit proﬁt growth in the two most recent quarters. Analysts\nsaw the operator of Carl’s Jr. burger shops increasing proﬁt by a whop-\nping 700 percent from year-ago levels in the upcoming quarter. The stock\nclimbed for 103 weeks. It ﬁnally peaked near $41 in October 1997 for a\n412 percent gain. During its price advance, CKE averaged a spectacular\n175 percent growth in earnings from 1995 to 1997. Its P/E fell to 47, or 1.8\ntimes the P/E of the S&P. Apollo Group (APOL)\nMost of the time money in stocks is lost not because the P/E was too high\nbut because earnings did not grow at a high enough rate to sustain expecta-\ntions; the growth potential of the company was misjudged. The ideal situ-\nation is to ﬁnd a company whose growth prospects warrant a high P/E: a\ncompany that can deliver the goods—and the longer it can maintain strong\ngrowth, the better. Consider the example of Apollo Group. From mid-2001 through 2004,\nthe P/E ratio for Apollo was virtually unchanged despite a 200 percent rally\nin the price of the stock. Why did the P/E remain at the same level as it\nwas several years earlier even though the stock price soared? Because earn-\nings kept pace with the stock’s price appreciation. If a company can deliver\nstrong earnings as fast as or even faster than its stock price appreciates, an\ninitial high valuation may prove to be very cheap. Apollo Group went pub-\nlic in December 1994 with a market value of only $112 million. Apollo met\nor beat Wall Street estimates for 45 consecutive quarters. As you can prob-\nably imagine, this led the company’s stock price to superperformance status.

From 2000 to 2004, Apollo Group’s stock advanced more than 850\npercent. During the same period, the Nasdaq Composite Index was down\n60 percent.

But fads come and\nfads go, and perhaps the world is ﬁnding that when it comes to Crocs, the\nshoe no longer ﬁts. The P/E ratio for Crocs contracted from April 2006 to\nOctober 2007 as earnings grew faster than the stock’s price appreciation. If you had bought Crocs when shares were trading at more than 60x earn-\nings—the most expensive P/E in its history—you could have reaped a return\nof 700 percent on your money in only 20 months.

In Search of  Value\n\nIn 1987, Irises, a painting by Vincent van Gogh, sold for $49 million, a world\nrecord for a work of art. The painting changed hands at a price more than\ndouble what it had been expected to reach. The sale was also accomplished\nin what may have been record time in light of the ﬁgures involved; the bid-\nding rose from a starting point of $15 million to reach the ﬁnal sale price in\nless than two minutes. Analysts and investors search continually for some intrinsic value that\ndiffers from a stock’s current market price. Often that quest boils down to\nrelating a stock’s price to its earnings.

More often than not, the market leader that appears\nexpensive actually turns out to be cheaper in the long run than the lower-\nP/E, poorer-performing stocks in the group. The other method is to compare a stock’s P/E with its own historical\nrange for a certain period.

The bottom line: value investing does not protect you. No Magic Number\n\nAs history has shown, there is no common denominator or appropriate level\nwhen it comes to a P/E ratio and superperformance stocks. The P/E can start\nout relatively low or high. My suggestion is to forget this metric and seek out\ncompanies with the greatest potential for earnings growth. Most of the time,\na true market leader is a much better value than a laggard despite its higher\nP/E multiple. Crossing a stock off your list because its P/E seems too high\nwill result in your missing out on what could be the next great stock market\nwinner. The 25 top-performing stocks from 1995 to 2005 had an average P/E\nratio of 33x, ranging from a low of 8.6x to a high of 223x.

All three saw their stock prices rise at\na 40 percent or better compounded annual growth rate over the 10-year\nperiod. In early 1995, CKE Restaurants traded at a relatively high P/E ratio\nbefore staging a massive rally and then at a relatively low P/E before experi-\nencing a major decline. Warning: The Superlow P/E\n\nOne of the worst trades I ever made was Bethlehem Steel trading at\n\n2x earnings. I said “How low can it go?” It went to zero. —Jim Cramer\n\nAlthough I don’t concern myself too much with the P/E ratio in my search\nfor superperformance stocks, there is one situation that gets my attention. As a rule of thumb, I’m very reluctant to buy shares of a company trading\nat an excessively low P/E, especially if the stock is at or near a 52-week low\nin price. A stock with an exceptionally low P/E ratio can turn out to be real\n\nT R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\ntrouble. A stock trading at a multiple of three, four, or ﬁve times earnings or\nat a number far below the prevailing industry multiple could have a funda-\nmental problem. The future prospects of the company may be questionable;\nearnings could be headed much lower. The company might even be headed\ntoward bankruptcy. Remember, the market is a discounting mechanism that trades on the\nfuture, not the past. Just as you can’t drive a car by looking only in the rear-\nview mirror, you shouldn’t run a stock portfolio on backward-referencing\nvaluation metrics. I would rather own a stock that’s reporting strong earn-\nings trading at a relatively high P/E ratio than a stock showing signs of trou-\nble trading at a very low P/E. P/E Deception\n\nIf you compare a stock’s share price with its P/E ratio, often you will see\nthat a depressed P/E coincides with a depressed stock price and vice versa. The same could be said about an overbought/oversold technical indicator\nsuch as the stochastic oscillator. On the surface, both of these popular met-\nrics appear to have a degree of accuracy at turning points because the eye is\ndrawn to peaks and troughs. However, this 20/20 vision is usually a gift of\nhindsight. In real time, the eye is not very good at ﬁltering out all the noise\nand static between the upturns and downturns. In addition, what is mostly\nignored or misunderstood is the varying time frames spent in the direction\nof the countertrend reading. For example, one stock can remain overvalued\nfor months whereas another stock can remain at a similar valuation for years\nbefore a change in direction takes place. Trying to buy oversold conditions and sell overbought conditions as\na trading strategy is risky business. Trading with disregard for a strong\ndirectional trend will ultimately lead to buying into a precipitous decline. Similarly, buying stocks simply because the P/E is relatively low and sell-\ning because the P/E seems too high produces poor results time and time\nagain. Although overbought and oversold conditions as well as high and\nlow P/Es can exist at turning points, stocks can also have extreme high\nand low readings in a directional fashion just before major advances and\n\n\fC H A P T E R   4   V A L U E   C O M E S   A T   A   P R I C E\n\ndeclines. Major market declines always plunge to deeply oversold readings,\nand roaring bull markets storm through early overbought conditions while\nadvancing much farther. The Broken Leader Syndrome\n\nA common afﬂiction among many investors, including some professionals,\nis what I call the broken leader syndrome. Here’s how it works. Investors who\nrefused to buy a dynamic new leader when it was emerging—before it sky-\nrocketed—become interested after that stock has topped and broken down\nin price. Usually this occurs during a stage 4 decline. These people buy stocks\nthat were previously expensive, thinking they will go back up. The broken leader syndrome affects investors who weren’t able to spot\nstocks such as Yahoo!, Amazon, and Apollo Group before their biggest price\nmoves. They weren’t on board when one of these incredible stocks made a\nhuge run of several thousand percent. Then the stock gets slammed. Now\nthese investors think they’re on to something. With a former highﬂier well\noff its peak, these latecomers to the party think the stock looks good and is\nnow a bargain. They use all sorts of reasons, such as “it’s trading near the low end of its\nhistoric range” and “it’s trading at only 20 times earnings and has a growth\nrate of 40 percent.” Worse yet, they’ll say, “It’s down 70 percent. How low\ncan it go?”\n\nWith all their rationalizing, they ignore the supreme fundamental: the\nmarket’s judgment. They stayed away when the stock was a market leader\n(probably because it looked expensive), and now they fail to recognize a\nbroken leader. When a leader tops, more often than not the stock price is\ndiscounting a future slowdown in growth, which makes it no bargain at all. Sun Microsystems is a good example of a broken leader play. The stock\nhad an incredible price advance during the 1990s and then topped out in\nlate 2000. Investors who were waiting for this powerhouse to correct, or\n“come in,” so that they could buy it may have been elated to see the stock\noff 75 percent from its high in 2001. Unfortunately, the party was over, and\na year later Sun’s stock fell a further 80 percent. Eight years later, investors\n\nT R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\nFigure 4.10  Sun Microsystems 1994–2009\n\nwho bought the stock at the discounted 75 percent off price not only didn’t\nmake money, they actually lost 99 percent of their capital. Here’s a common misperception when a stock has a precipitous drop. A stock that falls from $100 to $25 has declined by 75 percent. Since a stock\ncan drop only 100 percent, the thinking is that the risk is only an additional\n25 percent, right? Wrong! If you buy the stock at $25, you could lose another\n75 percent if it falls to $6.26. And if you buy it at $6.26, you could lose yet\nanother 75 percent if it falls to $1.56. After all, your money in the stock is\nalways 100 percent. P/E Ratio Is a Barometer of  Sentiment\n\nBy themselves, P/E ratios aren’t very helpful in determining the potential\ndirection of a stock’s price. The P/E ratio tells you what the market is will-\ning to pay for a company’s earnings at the current time. Think of the P/E as a\nbarometer that measures the level of expectation. This is why many growth\nstocks experience P/E expansion during the growth phase; expectations keep\ngetting higher as the company’s performance expands. C H A P T E R   4   V A L U E   C O M E S   A T   A   P R I C E\n\nOf course, there comes a time when the stock’s prospects darken and\nbusiness conditions change. The company may then be considered over-\nvalued. At that point, perceptions change and the stock price will adjust to\nreﬂect the new set of circumstances. I use the P/E ratio as a sentiment gauge\nthat gives me some perspective about investor expectation. Generally\nspeaking, a high P/E means there are high expectations and a low P/E\nmeans there are lower expectations.

Look for\nnew emerging trends that can translate into mass expansion: trends that are\nscalable. Concentrate on entrepreneurially managed companies with excit-\ning things going on (a catalyst), and you’ll eventually latch on to some big\nwinners. The current P/E ratio at which a company trades is only a minor\nconsideration compared with the potential for earnings growth. Growth\nstocks are driven by growth. The PEG Ratio\n\nThe price/earnings to growth (PEG) ratio is calculated by dividing the P/E\nmultiple by a company’s projected earnings per share growth rate over the\nnext year. For example, if a stock is trading at 20 times earnings and has a\ngrowth rate of 40 percent, the PEG ratio will be 0.5 (20 (cid:2) 40). The company\nis trading at half its growth rate. The theory is that if the resulting value is less than 1, the stock may be\nundervalued; if the PEG ratio is over 1, the stock may be overvalued. The far-\nther the value is from 1, the stronger the signal is. In general, if a company’s\nearnings growth rate matches or exceeds its P/E multiple, investors using the\nPEG ratio for valuation may consider the stock fairly valued or even under-\nvalued. If the P/E multiple signiﬁcantly exceeds its growth rate, however,\nthe stock will be considered risky and overvalued according to this school\nof thought. Many analysts intent on buying growth at a reasonable price\n(GARP) use PEG ratios in various forms. The point at which a stock is deemed undervalued or overvalued can\nvary, depending on the analyst. Some investors look to pare their holdings\nin a stock as soon as its price multiple exceeds its growth rate by any margin. T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\nLike its P/E cousin, the PEG ratio can exclude some of the most dynamic\nand proﬁtable companies from a candidate buy list. The PEG ratio is lim-\niting on the two sides of the equation that are most valuable: when a stock\nhas an exceptionally high or low P/E. Should a stock with a growth rate of\n2 percent trade at two times earnings? Probably not. However, valuing a high-\ntechnology stock such as Yahoo!, which traded at 938 times earnings, was\nnearly impossible using traditional valuation measures. Another drawback\nof the PEG ratio as I see it is that many of the broken leader plays are attrac-\ntive with this method. This can entice you to buy into a stock that has put in\na major top and headed for negative surprises. Gauging P/E Expansion\n\nBecause P/E is a ratio, its value will be affected if either the numerator or the\ndenominator changes. For example, the P/E will expand if a stock’s price\n(numerator) rises faster than the company’s earnings (denominator). Both\nnumbers, however, can be moving targets, particularly when a company has\ngood potential for increasing its earnings and also is attracting buyers who\nare accumulating the stock, which pushes the price higher. To illustrate, let’s say Company A is trading at 25 times its earnings for\na P/E of 25. If it reports earnings that are 20 percent higher and the stock\nprice remains essentially unchanged, the P/E will drop to 20.83 times earn-\nings. If the stock price jumps 20 percent on the earnings news, the P/E will\nremain the same at 25 times earnings. Over time, as a stock grows more and\nmore popular and the price rises consistently, its P/E ratio can expand as the\nstock’s price appreciates at a faster rate than its earnings growth. If the stock\nrises signiﬁcantly over 12 to 24 months and the P/E expands by 100 to 200\npercent, doubling or tripling from where it started near the beginning or\nfrom the bottom of the major price move, it’s possible that the price move is\nin its later stage and is getting too widely recognized. Historical study of superperformance stocks shows that the average P/E\nincreased between 100 and 200 percent on average (or two to three times)\nfrom the beginning until the end of major price moves. This information\ncan be used in two ways. First, you can get an idea of a stock’s potential. You\n\n\fC H A P T E R   4   V A L U E   C O M E S   A T   A   P R I C E\n\ncan estimate what it might sell for as an average best-case scenario within a\nyear or two down the road from your initial purchase price, that is, if you’re\nbuying a dynamic leader in a bull market. You could estimate future earn-\nings and apply the expanded P/E number to get a rough idea of the stock’s\ntheoretical potential. Second, you can gain some perspective on how much of the company’s\ngood fortune has already been discounted by gauging how much P/E expan-\nsion has taken place already. Let’s say you buy a stock with a P/E of 20 at its\ninitial breakout from a sound base. Multiply 20 by 2 to 3 to see what the ratio\ncould rise to. That gives you 40 to 60. You hope that the stock continues to\nrally. Though it’s always prudent to look for sell signals, pay extra attention\nonce the P/E nears 2 and especially around 2.5 to 3 or greater. It could top soon\nafterward. If this occurs, look for signs of decelerating growth and signs of\nweakness in the stock price as your signal to reduce your position or sell it out. In  the  1990s,  as  Home  Depot  stock  became  an  institutional  favor-\nite, rampant enthusiasm ran the stock price up well ahead of its earnings\ngrowth. Home Depot’s P/E expanded from the mid-20s to 70x earnings in\njust two years after the stock bottomed from its 1990 bear market low. A\nperiod of sideways consolidation took place for the next four years while the\n\nFigure 4.11  Home Depot (HD) 1988–2008\n\nT R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\nearnings played catch-up with the stock price. Then, in 2000, Home Depot’s\nP/E ratio expanded by from 25x in 1997 to 75x. The stock topped shortly\nafterward. What Does All This Mean? As we’ve seen, what constitutes a high or low P/E is far less clear—or impor-\ntant—than you might have thought. What should you take away from this\ndiscussion? Should you ignore stocks that trade at relatively low P/Es and\nbuy only those with high ratios? Not necessarily. The bigger point is that the\nP/E ratio doesn’t have much predictive value for ﬁnding elite superperfor-\nmance stocks. There is no magic number when it comes to the P/E. In fact,\nthe P/E is far less important than a company’s potential for earnings growth. Stop worrying about the P/E ratio. If you have a company delivering\nthe goods as Apollo Group did, earning 40 percent per annum for four or\nﬁve consecutive years, whatever the initial P/E was is irrelevant; the P/E\ntakes care of itself. Leave the overintellectualizing and complex theories to\nthe professors and academicians and the valuation tactics to the Wall Street\nanalysts.", "char_count": 6737, "word_count": 1232, "created_at": "2025-11-01T06:08:54.601308Z"}

C H A P T E R   5\n\nTrading with\n\nthe Trend\n\nI don’t set trends. I just ﬁnd out what they are and exploit them. —Dick Clark\n\nM y  success  as  a  stock  trader relies on a combination of\n\nscience and art. Mechanical signals backed by scientiﬁc research\nand intuitive feel are both important tools. In the stock market, few things\nare purely black or white. To succeed, an astute stock trader must learn to\nread between the lines and decipher and make decisions often on the basis\nof incomplete information. There are, however, certain characteristics that\nare not ambiguous or even open for interpretation. I call them nonnegotiable\ncriteria. When I am screening for superperformance stocks, my initial ﬁlter is\nrooted in strict qualifying criteria that are based purely on a stock’s technical\naction and is designed to align my purchase with the prevailing primary trend. Once this initial criterion is met, I run “overlay screens” and look at the com-\npany’s fundamentals to narrow the remaining universe of candidates. Simply\nput, no matter how good a company looks fundamentally, certain techni-\ncal standards must be met for it to qualify as a buy candidate. For example, I\nwill never go long a stock that is trading below its declining 200-day moving\naverage (assuming 200 days of trading exist). No matter how attractive the\nearnings per share, revenue growth, cash ﬂow, or return on equity may be, I\n\nT R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\nwon’t consider buying a stock that is in a long-term downtrend. Why? I want\nto see some interest in the stock, preferably from big institutional investors. I’m not interested in being the ﬁrst one to the party, but I do want to make\nsure there’s a party going on. The goal is to eliminate stocks that are not worth\nmy time so that I can focus on contenders that have the best chance of being\nthe next superperformers. Buying stocks in long-term downtrends will sig-\nniﬁcantly lower your odds of owning a big winner. However, if you want to\nincrease the odds, you should focus on stocks that are in a conﬁrmed uptrend. Making Friends with the Trend\n\nNewton’s ﬁrst law states that an object in motion continues in motion. Things in motion possess inertia. An analogous property characterizes\nthe stock market: a trend in force tends to remain in force until something\noccurs to change it. In other words, the trend is your friend. Although this\nadage is familiar, some investors may not fully appreciate its wisdom. I\nremember when I ﬁrst grasped this concept in a meaningful way. the roster of market gurus and prognosticators were Ned Davis, founder of\nthe well-known institutional research ﬁrm Ned Davis Research, and Marty\nZweig, publisher of the popular market newsletter The Zweig Forecast; Marty\ncoined the phrase “the trend is your friend.” One of the speakers who caught\nmy attention not only for his colorful personality but also for his approach\nto the stock market was Stan Weinstein, who at the time published the stock\nmarket newsletter The Professional Tape Reader. Over lunch we had a chance\nto chat, and as Stan explained his method, he left me with a core concept\nthat has stayed with me ever since. Stan’s approach was based on a timeless principle of the four stages that\nstocks go through, placing importance on knowing what stage a stock is in at\nany speciﬁc time. The ideal scenario, as Stan saw it, was to buy stocks when\nthey are coming out of the ﬁrst stage and beginning to make a run higher,\nwhich is the second stage. Then the objective is to sell them as they approach\nthe peak of the cycle, which is the beginning of the third stage. The fourth\nstage, as you might guess, is a full-ﬂedged decline that you want to avoid or\n\n\fC H A P T E R   5   T R A D I N G   W I T H   T H E   T R E N D\n\nduring which you go short. I had previously read about Stan’s approach in\nhis book Secrets for Proﬁting in Bull and Bear Markets (McGraw-Hill, 1988). Although Stan wasn’t the only one to use this type of four-stage approach,\nhe was the ﬁrst I heard speak about it. I went on to adopt this concept as part\nof my stock analysis. Superperformance and Stage Analysis\n\nLike all stocks, superperformance stocks go through stages. Over the course\nof my trading career, I’ve taken a keen interest in studying the cyclical and\nsecular life cycles of stock prices. In particular, in examining the historical\nprice performance of the most powerful market leaders over many mar-\nket cycles, I could clearly see how they go through various stages. A stock\nwould trade sideways for a while and then move up rapidly. Eventually,\nthe rate of upward momentum would slow and become more erratic as the\nstock was under distribution and topping out. After a top came the decline. Sometimes, after the decline, the stock returned to a basing stage before\neventually making another run upward. The succession of one stage to the\nnext, through all four, could take several years. What I found through my\nstudy of the biggest price performers was that virtually every superperfor-\nmance stock made its big gain while in stage 2 of its price cycle. As interesting as it was to study the stages of stocks’ price maturation\nin hindsight, that didn’t help me determine in real time when stocks on my\nradar were in the optimal stage 2 phase. Moreover, I asked, What created the\nproﬁtable stage 2 advance? Hunting for a key to identifying the advent of\nsecond stages, I plotted and overlaid the underlying fundamentals of super-\nperformance stocks to see how they correlated with price movement. My\nobjective was to see whether there was any cause and effect in the movement\nfrom stage to stage and, if so, what it was. Stock Price Maturation: The Four Stages\n\nMy studies of big market winners gave me an in-depth view of each of the\nfour stages of a stock’s life cycle: from dormancy into growth to peak and then\n\nT R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\ninto decline. In addition to focusing on stock prices, I asked what was hap-\npening to trigger each of these phases. From a fundamental perspective, the\ncause almost always was linked to earnings: from lackluster performance to\nupside surprise and accelerating growth, eventually followed by decelerating\ngrowth and then disappointment. These underlying fundamental changes\ndrove big institutional players into and out of stocks, phases that could read-\nily be identiﬁed by the huge volume spikes that occurred during both the\nadvancing stage and the subsequent decline. I identify these four stages on the\nbasis of what is happening with the stock in terms of price action:\n\n1. Stage 1—Neglect phase: consolidation\n\n2. Stage 2—Advancing phase: accumulation\n\n3. Stage 3—Topping phase: distribution\n\n4. Stage 4—Declining phase: capitulation\n\nStage 1—The Neglect Phase: Consolidation\n\nStage 1 is when nothing noteworthy is happening. The stock is in a period of\nneglect; few big players are paying attention to the stock, or at the very least,\nthe market has not yet paid up for the company’s shares. During stage 1, a\ncompany’s earnings, sales, and margins may be lackluster or erratic along\nwith its share price. There may also be an uncertain outlook for the company\nor its industry. Nothing electrifying is happening to push the stock out of its\ndoldrums and attract the needed institutional volume support to move it\ndecisively into a stage 2 uptrend. Stage 1 can last for an extended period, from months to years. Stage 1\ncan also be caused by a poor overall market environment. During a bear\nmarket decline, even stocks with good fundamentals can mark time and do\nnothing or even decline along with the overall market. You should avoid\nbuying during stage 1 no matter how tempting it may be; even if the\ncompany’s fundamentals look appealing, wait and buy only in stage 2.", "char_count": 8625, "word_count": 1532, "created_at": "2025-11-01T06:08:54.601308Z"}

If your stock is dead in\n\n\fC H A P T E R   5   T R A D I N G   W I T H   T H E   T R E N D\n\nthe water, guess where it’s most likely to stay until something signiﬁcant\nchanges. You’re not going to achieve superperformance by sitting with dead\nmerchandise. To compound capital at a rapid rate and achieve superperfor-\nmance, it is vital that you avoid stage 1 and learn to spot where momentum\nis strong during stage 2. Stage 1 Characteristics\n\n(cid:115)(cid:0) During stage 1, the stock price will move in a sideways fashion\nwith a lack of any sustained price movement up or down. (cid:115)(cid:0) The stock price will oscillate around its 200-day (or 40-week)\n\nmoving average. During that oscillation, it lacks any real trend,\nupward or downward. This dead in the water phase can last for\nmonths or even years. (cid:115)(cid:0) Often, this basing stage takes place after the stock price has\n\ndeclined during stage 4 for several months or more. Figure 5.1  Amgen (AMGN) in stage 1: 1987–1989\n\nT R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\n(cid:115)(cid:0) Volume will generally contract and be relatively light compared\n\nwith the previous volume during the stage 4 decline. No Bottom Picking Required\nI can tell you from experience that attempting to bottom ﬁsh—trying to\nbuy a stock at or near its bottom—will prove to be a frustrating and fruit-\nless endeavor. Even if you are fortunate enough to pick the exact bottom,\nmaking signiﬁcant headway usually requires sitting without much progress\nfor months and in some cases years, because when you buy a stock near its\nbottom, it is in stage 4 or stage 1 and therefore by deﬁnition lacks upside\nmomentum. My goal is not to buy at the lowest or cheapest price but at the “right”\nprice, just as the stock is ready to move signiﬁcantly higher. Trying to pick\na bottom is unnecessary and a waste of time; it misses the whole point. To\nachieve superperformance, you need to maximize the effects of compound-\ning; thus, it’s important to concentrate on stocks that move quickly after you\nbuy them. You want to focus on stocks that are already moving in the direc-\ntion of your trade. To accomplish this, you should wait for a stage 2 uptrend\nto develop before you invest. Transition from Stage 1 to Stage 2\nA stage 2 advance may begin with little or no warning; there are no major\nannouncements or news. One thing is certain, however: a proper stage 2 will\nshow signiﬁcant volume as the stock is in strong demand on big up days and\nup weeks, and volume will be relatively light during pullbacks. There should\nalways be a previous rally with an escalation in price of at least 25 to 30 per-\ncent off the 52-week low before you conclude that a stage 2 advance is under\nway and consider buying. In  the  following  figure,  note  that  the  200-day  moving  average  for\nAmgen has turned up and is in a deﬁnite uptrend. The 150-day moving\naverage is above the 200-day moving average, and the stock is trading above\nboth the 150-day and 200-day moving average during the markup phase. Note, too, the surging volume on the rallies, contrasted with lighter volume\non pullbacks.

This would be the point at which I would start to consider a new pur-\nchase; any earlier lacks conﬁrmation and is premature, meaning you run the\nrisk of being stuck in dead money. Most amateurs would think the stock is\ntoo high and wish they had bought it when it was lower, using hindsight as a\nguide. That’s why most amateurs don’t make big money in stocks.

Large up weeks on volume spikes are contrasted by low-volume\n\npullbacks. 6. There are more up weeks on volume than down weeks on volume. Stage 2—The Advancing Phase: Accumulation\n\nAlthough it may come without warning, a stage 2 advance can also be\nignited by surprise news such as a beneﬁcial regulatory change, a promising\nbusiness outlook, or a new CEO whose vision could improve the company’s\nprospects. Or perhaps it’s a new company that suddenly attracts notice with\na big earnings surprise that beat estimates. As the proverbial wind shifts and is now clearly at your back, the stage\n2 advance signals the potential for clear sailing ahead. With a buildup in\nearnings momentum (or in some instances earnings expectations), the stock\nprice starts to escalate because of a surge in demand for shares as big institu-\n\n\fC H A P T E R   5   T R A D I N G   W I T H   T H E   T R E N D\n\ntions buy the stock in size. A daily and weekly price and volume chart will\nshow big up bars representing abnormally large volume on rallies, con-\ntrasted with lower volume on price pullbacks. These signs of accumula-\ntion should appear during every stage 2 advance. By the time stage 2 is under way, the stock has been moving upward in a\nstair-step pattern of higher highs and higher lows. The share price may have\ndoubled or even tripled at this point; however, this may be only the begin-\nning. The stock could still move substantially higher. If the company contin-\nues to deliver strong earnings, the growth rate will soon attract widespread\nattention and subsequent buying, especially if the company has reported\nseveral quarters of impressive earnings gains. Stage 2 Characteristics\n\n(cid:115)(cid:0) The stock price is above its 200-day (40-week) moving average. (cid:115)(cid:0) The 200-day moving average itself is in an uptrend. Figure 5.3  Amgen (AMGN) in stage 2: 1992\n\nT R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\n(cid:115)(cid:0) The 150-day (30-week) moving average is above the 200-day\n\n(40-week) moving average. (cid:115)(cid:0) The stock price is in a clear uptrend, deﬁned by higher highs and\n\nhigher lows in a staircase pattern. (cid:115)(cid:0) Short-term moving averages are above long-term moving averages\n(e.g., the 50-day moving average is above the 150-day moving\naverage). (cid:115)(cid:0) Volume spikes on big up days and big up weeks are contrasted by\n\nvolume contractions during normal price pullbacks. (cid:115)(cid:0) There are more up days and up weeks on above-average volume\nthan down days and down weeks on above-average volume. Stage 3—The Topping Phase: Distribution\n\nAs the saying goes, all good things eventually come to an end. In the mar-\nket, stocks cannot keep up the momentum indeﬁnitely, churning out ever-\nincreasing percentages of earnings growth. At some point, earnings, though\nstill increasing, are going to rise by a smaller percentage. The stock price may\nstill be edging its way higher, although it may be experiencing more high vol-\nume pullbacks and increasing volatility. During stage 3, the stock is no longer under extreme accumulation;\ninstead, it is changing hands from strong buyers to weaker ones. Smart\nmoney that bought early when the stock emerged onto the scene is now tak-\ning proﬁts, selling into ﬁnal signs of price strength. As that occurs, buyers\non the other side of the transaction are weaker players who know about the\nstock because it has made such a dramatic run and captured headlines. In\nother words, the long trade in the stock has become crowded and too obvi-\nous. This distribution phase exhibits a topping pattern. Volatility increases\nmarkedly, and the stock becomes visibly more erratic relative to its previous\nstage 2 trading pattern. Earnings estimates that have been continually ratcheted up on contin-\nued upside surprises will be too high to beat at some point. A company can-\n\n\fC H A P T E R   5   T R A D I N G   W I T H   T H E   T R E N D\n\nnot keep beating estimates forever. At some point earnings per share (EPS)\nmomentum will start to slow. Either the stock price will anticipate that\nchange, trading lower than it did before the actual earnings event, or there\nwill be several quarters of slowing earnings growth (deceleration) and then\na breakdown in the stock price. Stage 3 Characteristics\n\n(cid:115)(cid:0) Volatility increases, with the stock moving back and forth in wider,\nlooser swings. Although the overall price pattern may look similar\nto stage 2, with the stock moving higher, the price movement is\nmuch more erratic. (cid:115)(cid:0) There is usually a major price break in the stock on an increase in\nvolume. Often, it’s the largest one-day decline since the beginning\nof the stage 2 advance. On a weekly chart, the stock may put in the\n\nFigure 5.4  Amgen (AMGN) in stage 3: 1993\n\nT R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\nlargest weekly decline since the beginning of the move. These price\nbreaks almost always occur on overwhelming volume. (cid:115)(cid:0) The stock price may undercut its 200-day moving average. Price\nvolatility around the 200-day (40-week) moving average line is\ncommon as many stocks in stage 3 bounce below and above the\n200-day average several times while topping out. (cid:115)(cid:0) The 200-day moving average will lose upside momentum, ﬂatten\n\nout, and then roll over into a downtrend. Stage 4—The Declining Phase: Capitulation\n\nAs the company starts to lose its EPS momentum and earnings slow down,\nat some point there will be a negative surprise. The company will miss an\nearnings estimate or preannounce earnings and guide Wall Street analysts\nlower. For some stocks in certain industries, this may be foretold by invento-\nries, with a buildup of ﬁnished product or retail goods that reﬂects declining\ndemand or greater competition in the marketplace, which hurts the compa-\nny’s growth prospects. What was once an uptrend that then transitioned into\na topping phase has turned into a full-blown stage 4 downtrend. During stage 4, earnings models are generally revised downward, which\nputs more selling pressure on the stock. The stage 4 selling may continue for\nan extended period until it’s ﬁnally exhausted, and the stock enters another\nperiod of neglect. As a stock languishes, it’s back to stage 1. It may take a\nwhile for the company to get back on the growth track and return to strong\nearnings, or the company may remain in stage 1 for many years. In some\ncases the company may go bankrupt. Stage 4 is essentially the opposite of stage 2 in terms of price and volume\ncharacteristics, with higher volume on down days and lower volume on up\ndays. You should deﬁnitely avoid buying while a stock is in stage 4. C H A P T E R   5   T R A D I N G   W I T H   T H E   T R E N D\n\nStage 4 Characteristics\n\n(cid:115)(cid:0) The vast majority of the price action is below the 200-day (40-week)\n\nmoving average.

Rather, the four stages are\nmost useful for gaining perspective on where a stock is in its life cycle price-\nwise and then to compare that with where the company is in its earnings\ncycle. A stock can go through the cycle many times. By studying the four\nstages, you will see clearly that you want to be involved in stage 2. I’m not at\nall interested in getting in early when a stock is still in stage 1, and I deﬁnitely\ndon’t want to hang around for stage 3, let alone stage 4. Figure 5.6  Amgen (AMGN) 1989–1997\n\nUsing Amgen as an example of a stock cycling through the various stages, you can\n\nclearly see why you would want to be long during stage 2 and avoid the other stages.

By itself, base counting will not tell you if a stock has topped or is about\nto move substantially higher. It does, however, provide a great way to gain\nperspective on where you are within the stage 2 advance. Combined with\nspeciﬁc price and volume analysis along with fundamental analysis, it can be\na very powerful tool. Base counting was introduced to me by Bill O’Neil and\nDavid Ryan many years ago; it is a valuable way to ascertain where a stock is\nwithin its price maturation cycle. Trust but Verify\n\nI never place much faith in my fundamental ideas about a particular com-\npany without conﬁrmation from the market, namely, the price of the stock. The way I see it is simple: if a company’s management is so great and its\nproducts are so great, the stock should at some point reﬂect those funda-\nmentals. If strong fundamentals are not conﬁrmed by the stock’s price\naction, the future may not be as bright as it appears. Or perhaps investor\nperception of the company has not changed or has not materialized yet. You\nwant to get on board when institutional money is pouring into a stock and\nlifting it signiﬁcantly higher. To do that, you need conﬁrmation that this\ninﬂow is starting to happen before you invest. Why is price action so important? Even if you’re correct in your fun-\ndamental analysis of the company, investor perception is what creates buy\norders, and you are going to need big buy orders in your stock to move it\nup signiﬁcantly. Keep in mind that if the institutional investment commu-\nnity doesn’t see what you see, your stock could sit dormant for an extended\nperiod. Why sit and wait when you can put your money in another stock\nthat is already on the move higher and has attracted big institutional volume\nsupport? To compound your capital rapidly, you must be where the action is;\nyou can’t afford to have your money tied up in a stock waiting for what you\nthink is a great fundamental story to get noticed by the rest of the world.

Heed a Trend Reversal\n\nAt some point your stock will reach its highest price and top out. This can\noccur with or without warning. Regardless of your fondness for or attach-\nment to a particular security, it’s important that you learn to detect and,\nmore important, respect a change in trend. Stocks very often top out while\nearnings still look good.

When topping signs start to appear after\na long, extended price run, it’s time to take your proﬁt and head for the\nexit. Companies will announce record earnings and try to create hype to\nkeep their stocks up. Carefully watch the stock’s price action for valuable\nclues to which way institutional investors are leaning and, like a tree, bend\nwith them.

Financial Stocks Warn of  Impending Trouble\n\nThe news media would have you believe that the troubles in ﬁnancials in\n2008 came out of nowhere. The truth, however, is that the stock prices of\nﬁnancial companies were falling in a stage 4 decline for many months, warn-\ning of trouble ahead. All you had to do to avert a major disaster was heed\nthe stage 4 decline and sell. Even if you bought near the all-time high price,\n\nFigure 5.15  Citigroup (C) 2004–2009\n\nWarning signs were abundant in Citigroup (C) with a stage 4 decline under way in\n\nlate 2007 and early 2008, long before the worst of the ﬁnancial crisis hit.

For many of the ﬁnancial stocks, such as Citigroup and Bank\nof America, there were clear-cut warnings. At the time, if you held those\nnames, you should have sold or at least reduced your position progressively\nuntil you were in cash.

This was the result of large institutional investors anticipating a loss\nof earnings momentum going forward and exiting the stock in anticipation. By the time a material change in earnings was reported, Vicor’s stock price\nhad already declined by almost 70 percent. As you look at Crocs (next), note how the negative quarter (–71 per-\ncent) was reported long after the stock topped and not until the price was\nalready down 73 percent from its high.

When\nthat happens, take heed. Before it becomes apparent that the fundamentals\nhave changed, a major break in the stock price often will occur on over-\nwhelming volume. If your stock experiences its largest daily and/or weekly\nprice decline since the beginning of the stage 2 advance, this is a sell signal in\nmost cases even if it comes on the heels of a seemingly great earnings report.

Notwithstanding a one-\nday 5 percent dead cat bounce (a short-term recovery from a selloff that did\nnot resume the uptrend), the share price dropped another 29 percent over the\nnext six trading days. On November 13, 2008, Crocs stock traded as a penny\nstock at $0.79 per share, down 99 percent off a high of $75 just a year earlier.

Let the Wind Fill Your Sails\n\nAs we’ve discussed in this chapter, to achieve superperformance, you need\nthe powerful force of institutional buyers on your side to propel your stock’s\nprice sharply higher. A proper stage 2 uptrend provides evidence that insti-\ntutions are indeed stepping up to the plate, just as a stage 4 decline clearly\ndemonstrates the opposite.

If there’s no wind, you’re dead in\nthe water (stage 1), and if the wind is against you, you have little chance\nof moving forward (stage 4). The proverbial wind in your sails is the long-\nterm trend of big money that’s buying in sync with you. You should look to\nalign yourself with this powerful force. Stick with stocks that are in a solid\nuptrend and you will be much more likely to own a stock that has the poten-\ntial to skyrocket and become a superperformer. C H A P T E R   6\n\nCategories, Industry\n\nGroups, and Catalysts\n\nW hen I’m considering a stock for purchase, the ﬁrst thing I\n\ndo is determine the type of situation I’m dealing with. In the\ncontext of the nature of the business and the industry in which a company\noperates, I want to develop an expectation of its prospective earnings growth\nand ﬁnd out whether those prospects are widely recognized and therefore\ndiscounted in the current stock price. Categorizing companies is a good way\nto gain perspective and organize your thoughts about a particular stock. It\nwill help you establish the type of company you’re considering relative to\nothers in the market so that you can make a judgment about where the stock\nis in its maturation cycle or curve. Companies don’t stay in the same part of\nthe curve forever, and some spend more time than others in certain phases\nof the cycle; however, nearly all companies undergo a natural maturation. Over the years I have analyzed tens of thousands of publicly traded compa-\nnies. What I’ve discovered is that they generally tend to fall into one of six\ncategories:\n\n1. Market leaders\n\n2. Top competitors\n\n3. Institutional favorites\n\nT R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\n4. Turnaround situations\n\n5. Cyclical stocks\n\n6. Past leaders and laggards\n\nThe Market Leader\n\nMy favorite type of stock to invest in—the area where I have made most of\nmy money trading—is the market leader. These companies are able to grow\ntheir earnings the fastest. An industry’s strongest players are usually num-\nber one, two, or three in sales and earnings and are gaining market share. Market leaders are easy to spot, but most investors have psychological dif-\nﬁculty deciding to buy them. The share prices of market leaders power up\nthe most percentagewise in the initial stages of a market rally. They move\ninto new high ground ﬁrst. That unbelievable price strength causes most\ninvestors to think these stocks have run up too far; hence, most investors are\nafraid to buy the very best stocks capable of superperformance. What propels them even higher? Institutions that know enough about\na company and its future prospects provide the buying power. They are not\nconcerned about how far the stock has already advanced but about where\nit’s going and what the prospects are for future growth. The best type of\ngrowth situation is scalable growth: a company gaining market share in a\nrapidly growing industry.", "char_count": 3777, "word_count": 679, "created_at": "2025-11-01T06:08:54.602309Z"}

A  company  that  is  taking  market  share  in  a  slow-growth  industry\ncan also grow its earnings quite nicely. What’s most important is that the\ncompany can make substantial proﬁts. A good balance sheet, expanding\nmargins, high return on equity, and reasonable debt are all signs of good\nmanagement. Some market leaders grow earnings at a very healthy rate for\n\n\f  C H A P T E R   6   C A T E G O R I E S ,   I N D U S T R Y   G R O U P S ,   A N D   C A T A LY S T S\n\nextended periods in industries with percentage growth rates in the low to\nmid-single digits. However, a company that is taking market share or has\na large portion of market share in a fast-growing industry can increase its\nearnings at a meteoric pace. The main questions should be: What is the company’s competitive\nadvantage? and Is the business model scalable? Then it’s a matter of whether\nmanagement is executing successfully and delivering the goods, namely,\nearnings. Market leaders are capable of producing huge price appreciation during\ntheir high-growth phase. They generally grow earnings at a rate of 20 per-\ncent or higher. Many average 35 to 45 percent during their best 5- or 10-year\nstretch. During their greatest growth period, some increase their earnings\nat triple-digit rates. From March 1989 through May 1993, Cisco Systems\naveraged over 100 percent quarterly earnings growth. Cisco’s stock price\nadvanced more than 13-fold in that period. During the early 1980s, when\nWalmart was a little-known company trading as few as 20,000 shares a day,\nearnings growth averaged 38 percent for 14 consecutive quarters. Walmart’s\nstock price appreciated 1,000 percent in that period. Today, Walmart trades\nmore than 7 million shares a day on average. When Expensive Is Actually Cheap\nMarket leaders in the high-growth stage are almost always going to appear\nexpensive. It only makes sense to value a rapidly growing company higher\nthan a slower-growing one. Here’s the beauty about ultrafast growers:\nthese companies grow so fast that Wall Street can’t value them very accu-\nrately. This can leave a stock inefﬁciently priced, providing a big oppor-\ntunity. As long as a company can sustain signiﬁcantly expanding sales and\nearnings, the stock price will follow—maybe not immediately, but stock\nprices do follow earnings growth over time. The faster a company can grow\nearnings, the more likely it is that its stock price will follow. Don’t be misled; there’s plenty of risk in high-growth companies. Wall\nStreet can punish a fast-growing company if earnings slow down even by the\nsmallest amount in relation to expectations. High-growth companies live and\ndie by earnings expectations. These companies have to constantly beat con-\n\nT R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\nsensus forecasts. As a company reports better than expected earnings, the bar\nmoves up for that company to beat them the next time. Eventually, the bar is\ntoo high and the company misses. However, as long as the company can deliver\nstrong earnings and manage expectations well, the stock price can soar and\nexperience P/E multiple expansion. The goal is to identify and invest in market\nleaders relatively early in the growth phase when proﬁts are accelerating. The Category Killer\nEvery so often a company comes along and totally dominates a category;\nthe company has such a clear and sustainable competitive advantage that\nother ﬁrms in the same market or niche ﬁnd it nearly impossible to com-\npete. These market leaders are known as category killers. A category killer is\na company whose brand and market position are so strong that it would\nbe difﬁcult to compete against it even if you had unlimited capital. A good\nexample is eBay, with an online auction site that gives it an overwhelming\nadvantage since buyers and sellers want to participate in the biggest mar-\nket with the most players. Therefore, they come to eBay, which gobbles up\nthe opportunity, leaving everybody else with the crumbs. Consider Apple,\nwhich dominates its space, setting the prevailing trend with innovative tech-\nnologies and truly unique products. Disney’s theme parks certainly rank as\na category killer with little formidable competition. So does a company such\nas Walmart, which has taken a toll on the retail sector, in which many stores\nﬁnd it hard to compete against the giant. The Cookie Cutter Concept\nWhen a ﬁrm produces a successful formula in one store and then replicates\nit over and over—in malls and in locations around the country or around\nthe world—it’s a cookie cutter. Think of McDonald’s, Walmart, Starbucks,\nTaco  Bell,  The  Gap,  Home  Depot,  Starbucks,  Chili’s,  Cracker  Barrel,\nThe Limited, Dick’s Sporting Goods, Wendy’s, Outback Steakhouse, and\nCostco Wholesale, which are great examples of successful rollouts of the\ncookie cutter concept. As you can see, many of the names that achieve success with the cookie\ncutter business model are in the retail area. With this concept, when a com-\n\n\f  C H A P T E R   6   C A T E G O R I E S ,   I N D U S T R Y   G R O U P S ,   A N D   C A T A LY S T S\n\npany expands into new markets, bringing on new stores rapidly (especially\nif same-store sales are brisk as well), earnings can accelerate at a healthy\nsustained pace. These types of companies are some of the easiest to spot,\nmonitor, and invest in during their high-growth phase. Their earnings up\ncycles last for a long enough time for you to identify earnings growth “on the\ntable” while they still have plenty of growth in the future. Points to Consider When Investing\nin the Cookie Cutter Model\nSame-store  sales,  or  what  is  also  referred  to  as  comparable  store  sales\n(comps), are a very important statistic used for analysis of the retail indus-\ntry. This statistic compares sales of stores that have been open for a year\nor more. This allows investors to determine which portion of new sales\nhas come from sales growth and which portion from the opening of new\nstores. This analysis is important because although new stores are a major\npart of a company’s expansion and earnings growth, a saturation point in\nwhich future sales growth is determined by same-store sales growth even-\ntually occurs. With these comparisons, analysts can measure sales perfor-\nmance against other retailers that may not be as aggressive in opening new\nlocations during the evaluated period. You want to see same-store sales\nincreasing  each  quarter. High-single-digit  to  moderate-double-digit\nsame-store sales growth is high enough to be considered robust but not\nso high that it’s unsustainable (25 to 30 percent or more same-store sales\ngrowth is deﬁnitely unsustainable over the long term). In general, same-\nstore sales growth of 10 percent or more is considered healthy. What factors affect same-store sales? The two main factors are prices\nand customer volume. By measuring the sales increase or decrease in stores\nthat have been open a year or more, you can get a better feel for how a com-\npany is really performing, because this measure—same-store sales—takes\nstore closings and chain expansions out of the mix. Rising same-store sales\nmeans that more customers are buying product at the stores or are spend-\ning more than they did a year ago or some combination of the two. This is a\nsign that management’s marketing efforts are paying off and that the brand\nis popular with consumers. T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\nFalling same-store sales obviously represents a problem. Weakening\n\ncomps could mean one of a few things:\n\n(cid:115)(cid:0) The brand is losing strength, and people aren’t shopping at the\n\ncompany’s stores. (cid:115)(cid:0) The economy is worsening, and people aren’t interested in\n\nshopping anywhere. (cid:115)(cid:0) The company has too many items at discount prices, and dollar\n\nvolume per customer is less than usual. Some companies grow by franchising their business or through a com-\nbination of company-owned and franchised stores. Although franchise fees\ncan lead to big proﬁts for the franchisor, the earnings are considered lesser\nquality than a company-owned base with less earnings stability. If the com-\npany franchises a relatively high percentage of new store openings, the risk\nof store failures and an earnings disappointment is heightened. In 2007,\nMcDonald’s, one of the best- run franchise cookie cutter models in history,\nhad about 60 percent of its restaurants operated by franchisees. Another important consideration for the cookie cutter model (par-\nticularly if the business concept is relatively new) is a past track record of\nsuccess in diverse geographic locations (Northeast, South, Midwest, inter-\nnational, etc.). You want to get evidence that the model is scalable. In addi-\ntion, too much, too fast can be a red ﬂag.", "char_count": 9264, "word_count": 1587, "created_at": "2025-11-01T06:08:54.602309Z"}

In 1981, MCI Communications challenged the dominant market leader\nAT&T. MCI reported strong earnings as the stock price emerged from a\n17-week consolidation and made a new high on April 2, 1981, but that was\nonly the beginning. Over the ensuing 22 months MCI’s stock advanced\n500 percent. A  top  competitor  may  not  be  the  superior  company  in  an  indus-\ntry group or even have superior products compared with the true market\nleader; rather, it’s in the right place at the right time. Even though it may be\nin the same rapidly growing industry as the market leader, the company’s\nproducts or stores may be less popular or in some way inferior to those of\nthe leader. These “competitor” companies can also produce high rates of\nearnings growth and enjoy large-scale price advances, albeit inferior to that\nof the leader. Even so, the number two company in an industry can even-\ntually take market share from the leader and in some cases take over the\nnumber one spot. The stock prices of top competitors can reﬂect this phe-\nnomenon, performing relatively well while the market leader digests its pre-\nvious stock gains. From 1990 through 2000, Home Depot’s stock price advanced 3,700\npercent, more than a 40 percent compounded annual rate of return. During\nthat period, Lowe’s stock advanced only 1,000 percent, amassing only about\na quarter of Home Depot’s price advance. Then, from January 2000 through\nJanuary 2004, Lowe’s stock price ran up more than 100 percent while Home\nDepot’s stock price actually fell, giving back more than 40 percent from its\nall-time high. This put the 14-year track record for Lowe’s up 2,900 per-\ncent and for Home Depot up only 1,800 percent. Home Depot had been the\nleader for more than a decade, and for investors who saw its potential, it was\njust a matter of when they got on board. Always track the top two or three stocks in an industry group. The\nonline access provider America Online was the clear leader in the Internet\nmarket until the search engine Yahoo! moved into the top slot. Google, a\n\nT R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\ndirector competitor to Yahoo!, then went public and is now considered the\nnumber one powerhouse in search engines. A competitor of the market\nleader can offer a great investment opportunity, especially if it’s in a strong\nindustry group. Like a NASCAR racer who follows in the leader’s draft, wait-\ning to make a pass at the right moment, a top competitor can ride the heels\nof a market leader and eventually win market share. You should concentrate\non the top two or three stocks in a group: the leaders in terms of earnings,\nsales, margins, and relative price strength. This is especially true if the indus-\ntry group is a leading sector during a bull market. Netflix Goes Public; Blockbuster Tops\nIt’s no coincidence that within only 15 trading days of Netﬂix going public,\nBlockbuster Video’s stock permanently topped out. It makes sense; com-\npetition rears its head, providing a more convenient solution to the movie\nrental business. Blockbuster’s stock price topped at the same time Netﬂix\ncame on the scene, almost as if the dollars from its shares were rotating\ndirectly out and into its new competitor. I could see this story unfolding in\nmy own neighborhood as the mom-and-pop video rental stores went out\nof business one by one. Then the small regional chains started closing their\ndoors, and the writing on the wall was beginning to look crystal clear; brick-\nand-mortar video rental was on its way out. Coming off the market bottom in 2009, Blockbuster was plagued with\ndeclining sales as the stock traded as low as $0.13. This was off a high of\n$18.00! Meanwhile, on March 18, 2009, just seven days after the Nasdaq\nComposite traded at its bear market low and only 10 days after the Dow\ntraded at its bear market low of 6,469, Netﬂix hit an all-time high. Just 17\ntrading days later Netﬂix’s stock price was up an additional 20 percent. Sales had been brisk and accelerating over the previous three quarters from\n11 percent to 16 percent and 19 percent, respectively. Earnings were even\nmore impressive, up 36 percent, 38 percent, and 58 percent, respectively. In October 2009, I was buying Netﬂix shares. Netﬂix’s earnings, sales, mar-\ngins, return on equity, and debt levels all were superior to those metrics at\nBlockbuster. Netﬂix was trading at 32x earnings while Blockbuster traded\nat just 2x earnings. Which stock was really the “cheap” stock?

During the same period Blockbuster’s stock price lost 99 percent\nof its value. The Institutional Favorite\n\nInstitutional favorites are also referred to as quality companies or ofﬁcial\ngrowth stocks, but don’t let those titles impress you too much. These are\nmature companies, and they’re certainly no secret. They generally have a\ngood track record of consistent sales and dividend growth, and they often\nattract conservative institutional capital because of their proven history\nof management’s ability to increase earnings, expand margins, and create\nshareholder value. Their earnings growth is generally in the low to mid-\ndle teens. These companies are regarded as the ones that most likely won’t\ngo out of business. Often they are referred to as blue chips or stalwarts. Examples include Coca-Cola, Johnson & Johnson, and General Electric, to\nname a few. Although all that sounds good, there’s one problem: they’re\nusually big and sluggish by the time they reach institutional favorite status. Although their earnings are deemed to be consistent and of high quality,\nusually the growth is slow, and the companies are so widely followed that\nthere’s little room for rapid price appreciation. In certain markets these stocks can come into favor and do quite well. However, you’re not likely to get a superperformance move out of General\nElectric or Procter & Gamble. Sometimes mismanagement, some other mis-\nfortune, or a severe bear market correction will drive some of these compa-\nnies down precipitously. As the stocks recover, they can make a nice advance\ncoming out of the correction phase. The Turnaround Situation\n\nBig proﬁts can be made in troubled companies that turn around. In pur-\nchasing a turnaround situation, you should look for companies that have\nvery strong results in the most recent two or three quarters. You should\n\n\f  C H A P T E R   6   C A T E G O R I E S ,   I N D U S T R Y   G R O U P S ,   A N D   C A T A LY S T S\n\nsee at least two quarters of strong earnings increases or one quarter that\nis up enough to move the trailing 12-month earnings per share to near\nor above its old peak. In looking at turnarounds, ask yourself: Are proﬁt\nmargins recovering, and are they at or close to the peak? Are the results\nbased only on cost cutting? What is the company doing to increase earn-\nings beyond cost cutting, productivity enhancements, and shedding losing\noperations? How much cash does the company have? Although a company\ncan burn its cash, you can try to assess the burn rate and debt load to get\nan idea of how long it can last while running in the red. How much debt\ndoes the company have? Bank debt is the worst kind and is less favorable\nthan bond debt. How long can the company operate while it works out its\nproblems? It’s important to follow the story and ascertain whether the turn-\naround is running better than, worse than, or as expected. Worse than\nexpected is usually a reason to consider selling. I look for acceleration in\nthe growth rate in the most recent couple of quarters compared with the\nthree- and ﬁve-year growth rate, which often is negative or reﬂects very\nslow growth. The most important questions to ask in purchasing a turn-\naround are: Is the stock acting well in market? and Are the fundamentals\ncoming in strong? You want to see both. Turnaround stocks are up against\nrelatively easy comparisons from earlier quarters, and so it’s important to\nsee the most recent results up signiﬁcantly: generally 100 percent growth\nor more in the most recent two or three quarters and a dramatic accelera-\ntion versus the past growth rate. Remember, stocks don’t necessarily stay in one category forever. This\nis why it’s important to understand the dynamics that are taking place with\nregard to a company’s products and services and the potential for sales\ngrowth. Apple Computer was a turnaround situation that morphed into a\ngrowth stock and since then has reached institutional favorite status. From\n2001 to 2003, revenue and margins were under severe pressure, which in\nturn led to lackluster earnings and a falling stock; the price of Apple’s shares\nwas down more than 80 percent from its high. Things were so bleak that\nwhen Michael Dell, founder of rival computer maker Dell Inc., was asked\n\nT R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\nApple Sales/Income Timeline\n\nSales\n\nOperating income\n\niPhone\n\nJobs Named\nInterim CEO\n\niTunes\nStore\n\nSteve Jobs Fired\n\niPod\nReleased\n\n$70,000\n\n$60,000\n\n$50,000\n\ns\nn\no\n\ns\ne\na\nS\n\n$40,000\n\n$30,000\n\n$20,000\n\n$10,000\n\n$24,000\n\n$20,000\n\n$16,000\n\n$12,000\n\n$8,000\n\n$4,000\n\n–$4,000\n\ns\nn\no\n\ne\no\nn\n\ng\nn\nt\na\nr\ne\np\nO\n\nFigure 6.2  Apple Computer (AAPL) 1985-2010\n\nApple Computer experiences a phenomenal turnaround on the heels of newly\n\nreleased products including the iPod, iTunes, and the iPhone.

Examples include auto manufacturers, steel producers, paper stocks,\nand chemical companies. Interestingly, cyclical stocks have an inverse P/E\ncycle, meaning they generally have a high P/E ratio when they are poised\nto rally and a low P/E near the end of their cycle. This is due to the fact that\nWall Street analysts try to anticipate the earnings-cycle dynamics of these\ncompanies, which are dependent on the business cycle. Growth investors\nmay become confused when they attempt to apply an earnings model to the\nselection process for cyclical stocks, and their stock picks do not respond\nlike a cookie cutter retailer or a high-growth technology company poised for\nmany continued quarters or even years of growth after earnings are already\non the table. This is the reason I put them into their own category and apply\na slightly different approach from what I do with stock categories that have\nsustainable growth prospects. With cyclical stocks, the trick is to ﬁgure out whether the next cycle\nturn is going to happen earlier or later than usual. Inventories and supply\nand demand are important variables in analyzing the dynamics of cyclical\nstocks. When the P/E ratios of cyclical stocks are very low after earnings\nhave been on the rise for many months or several years, it’s often a sign that\nthey’re near the end of their up cycle. When P/Es are superhigh and you’ve\nheard nothing but doom and gloom about the company or industry for an\nextended period, the bottom may be near. At the bottom of a cyclical swing, the following things happen:\n\n1. Earnings are falling. 2. Dividends may be cut or omitted. T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\n3.

Stay Away from the Laggards\n\nA laggard is a stock that belongs to the same group as the market leader but\nhas inferior price performance and in most cases inferior earnings and sales\ngrowth. These stocks can have periods of decent performance, usually brief\nones, as they try to catch up with the true leaders near the end of a cycle or\nduring times when a sector is red hot and the real leader has run up rapidly. The price moves in laggard stocks, however, usually pale in comparison to\nthose of the true market leader. Laggards usually appear to be relatively cheaper than market leaders,\nand that attracts unskilled investors. Don’t be tempted by a stock with a\nrelatively low P/E or one that hasn’t appreciated as much as has the leader\nin its industry. There’s always a reason why one stock trades at a high\nmultiple and another trades at a low multiple. More times than not, the\nexpensive market leader is actually cheap and the laggard is really the more\nexpensive choice. Over the years, many people thought buying Wild Oats, the smaller\nrival to Whole Foods, was a better way to play the healthy food trend because\nof its lower P/E. There was a good reason for the low P/E: Wild Oats failed to\ngenerate much in the way of earnings growth. Investors who concentrated\non earnings growth made a lot more money by owning Whole Foods even\nthough it was popularly perceived to be more expensive than Wild Oats.

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\nWhole Foods rarely traded below 30 times earnings during its dramatic\ngrowth phase. On the surface, it’s not surprising that many investors passed\non a grocer with such a high P/E, but if they had understood the growth\nopportunity, the high P/E wouldn’t have mattered much. The key for Whole\nFoods was its ability to expand earnings at a high rate, growing by more than\n20 percent on average. By doing that, the stock paid off big for its investors. Specific Industry Groups Lead\nNew Bull Markets\n\nThe formation of a bear market bottom typically begins with signs of accu-\nmulation in certain market sectors or segments. In general, 3 or 4 to as many\nas 8 to 10 industry groups or subgroups lead a new bull market. The market\ncan also have a broader theme such as growth, value, small-cap, large-cap,\nand so on. The leadership groups or categories can start to stage their bull\nmarket rallies before the broad benchmark’s bottom. For example, at the\n1974 market bottom, mid-cap and small-cap stocks began to show notice-\nable signs of accumulation during September and October even though the\nmajor market indexes did not bottom until December. When a new bull\nmarket began in March 2003, it was already apparent that investors had been\naccumulating ﬁnancial, energy, and basic materials stocks, as well as mid-\ncaps and small-caps, for several months. How do you ﬁnd which groups\nare leading? Follow the individual stocks. I like to track the 52-week new\nhigh list. The industry groups with a healthy number of stocks hitting new\nhighs early in a bull market will often be the leaders. Your portfolio should\nconsist of the best companies in the top four or ﬁve sectors. In a bull mar-\nket, some sectors advance several hundred percent and others barely beat\nthe average or even underperform. There are broad sectors that include a\nwide range of companies and subgroups. Healthcare/medical, technology,\nservices, basic materials, consumer cyclical, consumer noncyclical, ﬁnancial,\ntransportation, capital goods, energy, and utilities are all broad sectors. In  each  sector  there  are  subsectors  or  industry  groups. For  exam-\nple,  in  the  healthcare/medical  sector,  subsectors  include  drugs,  generic\ndrugs, ethical drugs, biotechnology/genetics, HMOs, hospitals, nursing\n\n\f  C H A P T E R   6   C A T E G O R I E S ,   I N D U S T R Y   G R O U P S ,   A N D   C A T A LY S T S\n\nhomes, outpatient/home care, medical equipment, medical services, and\nmedical supplies. Buying into the leading areas early in a bull market can lead to signiﬁ-\ncant capital gains. Some groups start emerging late in a bull cycle and can\nlead during the next upturn after a bear market. It’s deﬁnitely worth inves-\ntigating the industry groups in which the most stocks were resisting the\ndecline and then subsequently broke into new highs while the market was\ncoming off its lows or during the market’s initial few rallies. The top relative strength leaders in these groups typically lead their\ngroup’s advance from the beginning and are likely to show the greatest\nappreciation. When you see a growing number of names in a particular\nindustry making new 52-week highs (especially coming off a market low),\nthis could be an indication that a group advance is under way. I tend to let individual stocks lead me into an industry group or sec-\ntor, taking more of a bottom-up approach as opposed to top-down. I have\nfound that more often than not, the best stocks in the leading groups\nadvance before it’s obvious that the group or sector is hot. Therefore, I\nfocus on stocks and let them point me to the group. Not always, though. I still stay in touch with what is happening on an industrywide level, and if\nI see something that attracts my interest, I look at the stocks that make up\nthe industry and sort them according to my criteria. I look at the strongest\nstocks ﬁrst: the ones that have the best earnings and sales, are closest to a\nnew high, and show the greatest relative price strength versus the market. This is where you ﬁnd the real market leaders. History shows that big winning stocks tend to favor certain indus-\ntry groups. The groups that have produced the largest number of super-\nperformance stocks include the following:\n\n(cid:115)(cid:0) Consumer/retail\n\n(cid:115)(cid:0) Technology, computer, software, and related\n\n(cid:115)(cid:0) Drugs, medical, and biotech\n\n(cid:115)(cid:0) Leisure/entertainment\n\nT R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\nNew Innovations Create\nNew Opportunities\n\nMaterial changes in underlying conditions can have a dramatic effect\non group performance. This doesn’t mean that a stock must belong to\na strong group to make a big advance or imply that a strong tide will lift\nall the proverbial boats higher. Be on the lookout for new industries and\ncompanies with market niches, specialized expertise, proprietary technol-\nogy, or a positive sector change such as deregulation. Look for new tech-\nnologies or adaptations of old technologies that promise to help people\nwork better, live longer, and enjoy life more or that help companies cut\ncosts and improve productivity and efﬁciencies. Look for opportunities\nin companies undergoing positive changes. You can read industry trade\nmagazines. You can call company representatives and ask which publica-\ntions they recommend for keeping up with new industry events and hap-\npenings in their ﬁeld. When a new category is established or a company creates a new indus-\ntry, often it’s an extension of a broader group category.

Soon, laparoscopy was also being used for hernia operations,\nappendectomies, hysterectomies, and other types of abdominal surgery. With a virtual monopoly on sales of the equipment for these operations,\nUS Surgical saw its sales grow by 50 percent in 1990 and 75 percent in the\nﬁrst half of 1991. Earnings during that time grew by 78 percent, and by the\nend of the year they had nearly doubled. US Surgical sold more than $300\nmillion worth of laparoscopic equipment in 1991 to become one of the\nfastest-growing companies in the United States, with proﬁts of $91 mil-\nlion. Just a few years earlier US Surgical had sold only $10 million worth of\nlaparoscopic tools; by 1992 the company’s revenues for the year surpassed\n$1 billion.

For instance, the Iraq war and the 9/11 terrorist attacks had a dramatic effect\non military and defense companies. This in turn had an effect on electronic\nparts manufacturers, in particular, companies that manufactured delicate\nmeasuring devices. In the 1990s, healthcare reform boosted HMOs, and\nthat produced a need for cost-containment companies and software to help\nthose companies deal with patients and logistics. The advent of the personal\ncomputer had a direct effect on semiconductors. The proliferation of small\nhandheld devices produced demand for one-inch hard drives. High energy\nprices in the period 2006–2008 and ever-increasing worldwide energy use,\nas well as increased levels of pollution, have led to the proliferation of solar\nand alternative energy technology. Personal computing created the need for\nsoftware and peripherals, which in turn led to the widespread use of the\nInternet, creating the need for faster speed and broadband access. Now we\nsee social media and cloud computing as new frontiers. You can be assured\nthat future growth areas will show up in leading stocks of leading industry\ngroups. When the Leader Sneezes,\nthe Group Can Get a Cold\n\nJust as leading stocks can at times foretell a powerful group advance, keep-\ning an eye on the top two or three companies in an industry group could\nprovide a tip-off to when the group may be headed for trouble. It’s impor-\ntant to keep your eye on important leading names in the top-performing\nsectors. Often you’ll see an important stock in a group break badly, and\nthe whole group will suffer. If one or more important stocks in an industry\ngroup top, that could be a warning that the whole group will soon run into\ntrouble. Even stocks that are outside the group, such as suppliers and cus-\ntomers, may share in the suffering. Historically, more than 60 percent of\nsuperperformance stocks were part of an industry group advance.

New Technologies Become Old Technologies\n\nEvery innovation eventually ceases to be an innovation; in doing so, it fol-\nlows a path of market penetration and eventual saturation. This is a time-\nless truth. Initially, every new innovation (railroads, automobiles, radios,\ntelevisions, computers, the Internet, etc.) begins at a relatively high price\npoint that only a small market segment can afford. Progress in technology\nand manufacturing gradually reduces the relative price of the new product. This leads to market penetration in which more and more potential users\ncan acquire the new product or service. At some point market saturation is\nreached: all ﬁrms or households that will buy and use the new product have\naccess to it; good examples are the automobile and the television. The mar-\nket becomes largely a replacement market with overall unit growth bounded\nby the slow growth of the economy overall. Once a market reaches saturation, little room remains for further pen-\netration. Relative price declines have less and less of a positive impact on\nunit sales.

During such periods of market satura-\ntion, competitive pressures usually lead to severe declines in proﬁt margins. A former growth industry geared to rapid sales expansion enters a period of\nconsolidation in which competition becomes unusually intense. Such peri-\nods of consolidation are usually characterized by proﬁt rates well below the\nprior industry average, a decline in the number of companies in an industry,\nand bankruptcies. In the 1980s and 1990s, the PC-based high-tech industry\nunderwent such a process of market penetration. This was no different from\nthe experience of the automobile industry in the 1920s and the television\nindustry in the 1950s; however, the cycle moved at a faster pace, probably\nas a result of the increase in information ﬂow and access to world markets. C H A P T E R   7\n\nFundamentals\n\nto Focus On\n\nW hen  a  stock  suffers  a  major  break in price, there’s a\n\nreason,  and  very  often  it’s  the  beginning  of  lower  prices  to\ncome. In almost every case, something is fundamentally wrong with the\ncompany’s business or industry. Entering 2008, many of the big banks,\nincluding Citigroup, along with their broker-dealer and investing bank-\ning cousins such as Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns, were overlever-\naged and held deteriorating balance sheets. This toxic cocktail would set\nup the ﬁnancial sector for collapse as the overall economy was stunned into\na severe recession. From 2007 to 2009, former Dow component American\nInternational Group (AIG) crashed from a high of $103 down to a minus-\ncule $0.33. On September 22, 2008, AIG was removed from the Dow Jones\nIndustrial Index. Citigroup was removed from the Dow on June 8, 2009. You’ve heard the old adage about buying low and selling high, so maybe\nyou ﬁgure this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity—that is, to buy GE,\nCitigroup, or some other familiar company while it’s down in price. I bet\nthose who bought the blue chip carmaker General Motors in 2008 felt they\nwere getting a bargain, too. However, in just one year GM stock dropped to\na level not seen since 1933, shedding almost 95 percent of its value. On June\n8, 2009, General Motors was also removed from the Dow Jones Industrials\nIndex. The fact is, no matter how big or prestigious a company is, when\nfundamentals deteriorate—namely, earnings—you never know how far the\nstock will fall.

The stock market cares little about the past, including the status of a com-\npany. What it cares about is the future, namely, growth. Keep in mind that\nour goal is to uncover superperformance stocks: shares that will far outpace\nthe rest of the pack. These stocks are the ones with the strongest potential,\nand they seldom are found in the bargain bin. They are going strong because\nof a powerful force behind them: growth—real growth—in earnings and\nsales. Why buy damaged merchandise? If  your  goal  is  to  achieve  superperformance  in  stocks,  each  com-\npany must earn its place in your portfolio by being an outstanding busi-\nness. Superperformance stocks show their strength through their ability to\nimprove and grow earnings, sales, and margins. These powerhouse com-\npanies report quarterly results that are better than Wall Street anticipates,\nwith upside surprises that propel the stock higher. Don’t become enamored\nwith a stock selling down in price because it has a well-known name. Many\n\n\fC H A P T E R   7   F U N D A M E N T A L S   T O   F O C U S   O N\n\nwinning stocks may be companies that you never heard of before. Their\nbest days lie ahead, not in the past. Regardless of a company’s size, status,\nor reputation, there is no intelligent reason for an investor to settle for\nan inferior track record in a marketplace ﬁlled with companies with out-\nstanding fundamentals. Each quarter, earnings and sales reports provide a refreshed set of statis-\ntics with new names, as those with poorer prospects are often replaced with\nthose with greater potential. The same release of quarterly results also brings\nfresh data with which to evaluate the companies already in one’s portfolio. In this way, the portfolio naturally evolves to achieve its performance goal\nthrough forced displacement. Stocks that continue to deliver the goods can\nremain in the portfolio, and the ones that fail to perform must go. Why Earnings? In real estate, the mantra goes “location, location, location.” In the stock\nmarket, it’s earnings, earnings, earnings; after all, it’s the bottom line that\ncounts. How much money can a company earn and for how long? This leads\nto three basic questions every investor should ask when it comes to earnings:\nHow much? How long?", "char_count": 5576, "word_count": 985, "created_at": "2025-11-01T06:08:54.603315Z"}

Proﬁtability, sustainability, and\nvisibility represent the most inﬂuential factors that move stock prices. To understand the impact of earnings on stock prices, let’s go behind\nthe scenes and examine how Wall Street operates. Who moves stock prices? Big  institutional  investors  such  as  mutual  funds,  hedge  funds,  pension\nfunds, and insurance companies. Many institutional investors, encompass-\ning a relatively large number of investment professionals, use investment\nmodels that identify earnings surprises, that is, reported earnings that beat\nanalysts’ expectations. As soon as an earnings surprise is reported, these\nopportunists will jump onboard or at least put the stock on their radar\nscreens as a potential buy candidate. Most of the big institutional investors utilize valuation models that are\nbased on earnings estimates to determine a stock’s current worth or value. When a company reports quarterly results that are meaningfully better\nthan expected, analysts who follow the stock must reexamine and revise\n\nT R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\ntheir earnings estimates upward. This increases the attention paid to a\nstock. The upward estimate revision is going to raise institutional investors’\nprojected value of the company. When earnings estimates for a stock head\nup, shares, of course, become more attractive—and invite buying. Anticipation and Surprise\n\nStocks move for two basic reasons: anticipation and surprise. Every price\nmovement is rooted in one of these two elements: anticipation of news, an\nevent, an important business change, or reaction to an unexpected event\nand a surprise, whether positive or negative. Anticipation means expectation, for example, rumors that a large con-\ntract may be awarded to a contractor. In anticipation of an announcement,\nthe stock price may advance. Once the deal is on the table and the contract is\nofﬁcially awarded, the stock could sell off. The same thing can happen with\nearnings that are in line with expectations; once the announcement is made,\nthe stock declines because that event had already been priced into or dis-\ncounted in the stock price. Stocks often move in anticipation of good and\nbad news and then after the fact may move in the opposite direction (i.e.,\nrallying in anticipation of a favorable development and selling off when the\nannouncement is made). This market phenomenon may bafﬂe newbie inves-\ntors. The reason for it is that the stock market prices in future events. That is\nwhat is meant when people say the stock market is a discounting mechanism. Although anticipation moves prices, once the expected event occurs, the\nmarket sells on the news. Hence the old adage “Buy the rumor; sell the fact.”\n\nSurprises can take many forms, from earnings that were far above or\nbelow estimates to a sudden development that signiﬁcantly changes a com-\npany’s business outlook. What surprises have in common, by deﬁnition,\nis that they are unexpected. Suddenly, the idea of deregulating an indus-\ntry catches on in Congress or a drug that seemed unlikely to win U.S. Food\nand Drug Administration (FDA) approval unexpectedly gets the green light. With earnings, results come in well above expectations for a positive sur-\nprise or well below for a negative surprise. C H A P T E R   7   F U N D A M E N T A L S   T O   F O C U S   O N\n\nThe Earnings Surprise\n\nLet’s deﬁne what Wall Street means by an earnings surprise: simply stated,\na company’s earnings are better (or worse) than the consensus of analysts’\nestimates. You can ﬁnd out what the estimates are for a company’s earnings\nthrough news sources such as Yahoo! Finance, Zacks, and Brieﬁng.com. If a\ndozen analysts follow XYZ Corp. and the consensus (average) for quarterly\nearnings is $0.53 per share, if the company reports results of $0.60 a share,\nthat will be a $0.07 positive surprise. If the company reports $0.48 a share,\nthat will be a $0.05 negative surprise. A surprise could set off a ﬂurry of activity, including a wave of buying\nthat, in the case of a positive surprise, raises the stock price. Studies have\nshown that the effects of the surprise and the postnews drift (movement in\nthe direction of the surprise reaction) can last for months. Efﬁcient market\ntheory holds that the market reacts instantaneously and fully prices in new\ninformation completely. Experienced traders know that this theory is false\nfor several reasons. For one thing, it’s impossible for everybody to respond\nat the exact same time. Liquidity is also a factor; only so many shares are\navailable to be bought and sold. Large buyers must buy over time to avoid\nrunning a stock up too quickly, and if they sell too fast, they can crush the\nstock. This is what accounts for postearnings drift, a persistent bias in the\ndirection of the surprise. Be on the lookout for companies that are beating\nearnings estimates; the bigger the earnings surprise, the better. The Cockroach Effect\n\nThey call it the cockroach effect because as with cockroaches, if you see\none, you can bet there are others. The same thinking applies to companies\nreporting earnings surprises. If a company has posted very good quarterly\nresults that are much better than were anticipated by analysts, there are\nprobably more good quarters ahead. If a company is performing well with\nearnings surprises, other companies in the same industry or sector may post\nsome upside surprises as well.

The prospect of further surprises may lead to speculation by institu-\ntional investors in some stocks even before the earnings come out. Such a\nstrategy can be proﬁtable. An authentic earnings surprise for the quarter\nprobably portends higher earnings in the next quarter as well. The mirror\neffect often holds true for negative surprises. Companies that miss earnings\nestimates often disappoint again in subsequent quarters. Because earnings\nsurprises have a lingering effect, we want to focus on companies that beat\nestimates and avoid ﬁrms that have negative earnings surprises. One way\nto ﬁnd candidates is to check to see if earnings reported in the last couple of\nquarters were better than expected. Not All Surprises Are Created Equal\n\nNot all surprises are really surprises. Sometimes a company will beat the\npublished consensus number; for example, Company XYZ reports earnings\nof $1.23 a share versus the Street estimate of $1.20. Although that’s a $0.03\nupside surprise, don’t be unduly impressed with companies that beat ana-\nlysts’ estimates. News reports often emphasize that companies’ announced\nearnings beat analysts’ estimates by a penny or two a share; this isn’t any-\n\n\fC H A P T E R   7   F U N D A M E N T A L S   T O   F O C U S   O N\n\nthing new. Companies more often than not beat their estimates. This hap-\npens because they’re careful to guide expectations in their public statements\nduring the quarter, ensuring that analysts’ estimates converge around a\nnumber slightly below what management knows the company will deliver. It’s also partly due to a herd effect among analysts who don’t want their\nquarterly forecasts to be too far above or below the average of their peers. Analysts are typically conservative in making earnings estimates. Since\nthe market likes upside surprises and Wall Street ﬁrms are in the busi-\nness of selling stocks to consumers, you can see how this happens. When it\ncomes to estimates, there is no beneﬁt to being aggressive. If the majority\nof analysts are between, say, $0.25 and $0.30 a share in their earnings esti-\nmates and the consensus is $0.27, who would want to crank up the earnings\nmodel to project $0.40 a share? Even a better than expected earnings report\ncould look like an earnings disappointment; the stock could get clobbered,\nand as a result, the analyst could be out of a job. Being conservative and\nsafe within a reasonable range of the consensus number makes everybody\nhappy, especially if the company beats the estimates. Although it may look\ngood on the surface, don’t be fooled into thinking this is a true upside sur-\nprise. You are looking for a signiﬁcant event with results that beat estimates\nby a meaningful margin. Years ago, it was popular to discern the whisper number on the Street,\na shadowy ﬁgure that was more realistic than the published estimate or\nconsensus. The whisper number existed because company management\nonce could legally share information within a closed circle of certain ana-\nlysts; those analysts in turn would share that information with their big-\ngest clients. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 silenced the whisper number with\nstricter  rules  that  required  companies  to  disseminate  information  in  a\nmore restricted fashion, with stiff penalties for violations. Even earlier, the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission in August 2000 adopted Regulation\nFD (Fair Disclosure) to address “non-public information” (information\nthat had not yet been announced) that could be disclosed by publicly traded\ncompanies. In general, the rule states that if a company releases certain\ninformation to certain individuals, such as analysts, it also has to make a\n\nT R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\npublic disclosure of that information. The purpose of the rule is to promote\n“full and fair disclosure,” according to the SEC. Analysts’ Revisions of  Estimates\n\nWhen a company reports a meaningful earnings surprise, analysts who\nfollow that stock are likely to revise their earnings estimates. I like to see\nestimates raised not only for the current quarter but also for the current\nﬁscal year. Studies have shown that when estimates are revised upward by\n5 percent or more, stocks tend to show better-than-average performance. Conversely, with downward revisions of 5 percent or more, stocks exhibit\nlower than average performance. Generally, adjustments to estimates following an earnings surprise are\nmade shortly after the announcement. Sometimes, however, estimates are\nraised before an earnings report, for example, in the middle of the quarter. This reﬂects the expectation of good results. It may be that a product is sell-\ning better than expected or business conditions have improved. Analysts\nwho follow companies very carefully revise their estimates not only based on\nhistorical data but also because of what they learn by talking with customers\nand suppliers. As the reporting period approaches, estimates probably will start to\nconverge around the consensus estimate. It’s your job to watch a stock to get\nan idea of whether the price is already anticipating these expected results. Also note that when analysts raise their earnings estimates on the basis of the\nlatest results, this lowers the price/earnings (P/E) ratio of a stock because the\ndenominator—earnings—is larger. To calculate future earnings, analysts start with a revenue projection,\nsuch as all the contracts that a company has or says it will have. Then they\napply the company’s expected proﬁt margin and subtract a certain percent-\nage for taxes. The result is the earnings per share for the quarter or the year. Most of the inputs for an estimate come from company guidance in the\nform of press releases, conference calls, and personal one-on-one discus-\nsions with executives. The analyst may adjust the numbers in the earnings\nforecast on the basis of conversations with customers who may indicate that\n\n\fC H A P T E R   7   F U N D A M E N T A L S   T O   F O C U S   O N\n\nFigure 7.3  Earnings estimate revisions\n\nsales are not as good as projected or, conversely, better than the company\nhas stated. Or the analyst may determine that the company is going to qual-\nify for a lower tax rate. A competitor may be about to announce lower pric-\ning, which will lead to a price war that will grind down proﬁt margins. Look  for  companies  for  which  analysts  are  raising  estimates. Quarterly  as  well  as  current  ﬁscal  year  estimates  should  be  trending\nhigher; the bigger the estimate revisions, the better. At  the  very  least,\nI like to see the current ﬁscal year or the next year’s estimates trending\nhigher from 30 days earlier; if both are trending higher, that is even better. Although I won’t necessarily disqualify a stock as a buy candidate if it lacks\nupward earnings revisions, large downward estimate revisions are deﬁnitely\na red ﬂag. Big Earnings Attract Big Attention\n\nWhen a company delivers several quarters of strong earnings, this not only\nprompts more upward revisions of analysts’ earnings estimates and broker-\nage upgrades but also results in more coverage of the stock as additional\ninvestment houses assign analysts to follow the company. More upbeat\nanalysis can lead to more buying. The stock, which was hardly noticed just\na few quarters ago, is starting to attract attention and bask in the limelight. If earnings accelerate quarter by quarter at a strengthening pace, earn-\nings per share (EPS) momentum can propel the share price even higher. As\n\nT R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\nEPS momentum builds—for example, 10 percent earnings growth, then 30\npercent, 50 percent, and so on—the earnings momentum buyers will jump\non the bandwagon. A feeding frenzy is now under way, all of it fueled by EPS\ngrowth and expectations of future growth. As the stock’s price rises quickly because of the prospects of improv-\ning fundamentals from institutional buying, additional quantitative mod-\nels kick in and price momentum players start to buy the stock purely on the\nbasis of a strong price trend and price momentum. Some of these investors\nwill buy stocks that show strong price action regardless of the fundamentals. They believe that a stock that is rising strongly will continue to rise over the\nshort to intermediate term purely as a result of momentum. At some point, the growth becomes obvious and essentially everybody\nknows about it. The stock is ofﬁcially termed a growth stock. The smart\nmoney that got in early is getting out with a hefty proﬁt, and naive inves-\ntors step in to buy what they’ve been reading about in the ﬁnancial pages or\nhearing about on TV. Then the momentum stalls. What follows is the loss\nof EPS momentum, an eventual negative earnings surprise, and downward\nrevisions, all of which puts considerable pressure on the stock price. This\nearnings maturation cycle happens time and time again, market cycle after\n\nFigure 7.4  Earnings maturation cycle\n\nIn order to ﬁnd your next superperformer, look for stocks that are in stage 2 with\n\nstrong earnings, positive surprises, and upward revised estimates.

Get It on the Table\n\nBig earnings will eventually attract the big players and create the conditions\nfor big price performance. The length of time a stock remains in stage 2\ndepends on the company’s fundamentals, speciﬁcally, how long it’s able to\ncontinue its pattern of strong earnings growth. Some companies can keep\nthis up for quite a stretch. To take advantage of this phenomenon, you don’t\nneed to guess or predict, and you don’t have to settle for less than stellar per-\nformance in terms of fundamentals. Look for stage 2 uptrends supported by\nstrong earnings growth, and you will dramatically increase your chances for\nattaining big success in stocks. Sometimes a company with a rocketing stock price may not be mak-\ning much money, but the rising price means that investors are hoping that\nit will be proﬁtable in the future. However, three out of four times, the very\nbest performers will show meaningful earnings increases in the most recent\nquarter from the same quarter a year earlier. You should demand not only\nthat the most recent quarter be up by a meaningful amount but that the\npast two or three quarters also show good gains. In fact, it’s even better if the earnings are getting stronger sequentially\neach quarter. In our study of past superperformance stocks, as well as in the\nLove and Reinganum studies, current quarterly earnings showed the highest\ncorrelation with big stock price performance. To ensure that your stock is attractive to institutional investors, demand\nthat a minimum level of current quarterly earnings performance be met\nbefore investing. Many successful growth managers require a minimum of\n20 to 25 percent year-over-year increases in the most recent one, two, or\nthree quarters. The greater the percentage increases, the better. Really suc-\ncessful companies generally report earnings increases of 30 to 40 percent\nor more during their superperformance phase. In a bull market you can set\nyour minimum even higher; look to ﬁnd companies delivering increases in\nearnings of 40 to 100 percent or more in the most recent two to three quar-\n\nT R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\nters. Companies that report four, ﬁve, or six strong quarters in a row pro-\nvide even more assurance that they are on the right track. It’s important to know when the companies in your portfolio and the\nones on your watch list will report quarterly earnings. It’s not uncommon\nfor a company to issue a preannouncement about its results before the\nactual earnings date. You should, in addition, be aware of earnings reports\nand news from companies that are in the same industry group as the stocks\nyou hold. The following are some examples of big winners that had their earnings\n\non the table when they made a large-scale advance in price:\n\n(cid:115)(cid:0) March 1989 through May 1993: Cisco Systems (CSCO) reported\n15 out of 17 quarters of earnings increases of 100 percent or\nmore, with the other two quarters at 92 percent and 71 percent,\nrespectively. Cisco’s stock price advanced more than 13-fold\nduring this period. (cid:115)(cid:0) September 1989 through December 1992: Home Depot (HD)\n\nreported 14 consecutive quarters of earnings in excess of 29 percent;\nHome Depot’s stock price advanced more than 500 percent. (cid:115)(cid:0) From 1987 through 1991, Microsoft (MSFT) reported only one\n\nquarter below 36 percent for 16 straight quarters. The stock price\nadvanced more than 1,200 percent.

(CROX) was a ﬂash-in-the-pan retail fad, similar to a sneaker\ncompany I traded in the 1980s called LA Gear. Both had meteoric price\nsurges in a relatively short period because of rapid sales of their trendy shoes. Initially priced at $9.90, Crocs opened up 200 percent at $30 per share on\nFebruary 8, 2006. Crocs boasted triple-digit earnings per share every quar-\nter from June 2006 until September 2007. From its initial public offering\nthrough October 2007, quarterly earnings per share averaged 229 percent. The stock advanced a whopping 400 percent during that period. Hot one-product stocks that go from unknown to all the rage overnight\ncan be great investments if you get in and get out at the right time. Crocs\nskyrocketed while business was booming, albeit brieﬂy. There are count-\nless examples of companies that produced huge earnings growth as a result\nof a cyclical fad. While a product is selling rapidly, there can be a great deal\n\nFigure 7.5  Crocs 2006–2009\nCrocs Inc.

Whatever the reason, some sort\nof positive development in the company is accelerating the growth rate and\nthe share price. Although this rate of growth is not sustainable forever—no\ncompany can do it indeﬁnitely—it may last for 6, 9, or 12 quarters or even\nlonger with strong EPS momentum. If you get onboard during this period\nof strong earnings growth, the stock can rally 100 percent or even rise by\n300, 500, or in some rare instances 1,000 percent over a year or two. Vicor: Triple-Digit Earnings Propels Stock\nThe  earnings  cycle  phenomenon  is not  a  one-time  event  or  something\nunusual. It happens time and time again, market cycle after market cycle. The only thing that changes are the names. In 1991, I purchased shares of\nthe electronic equipment manufacturer Vicor Corporation (VICR), which\nadvanced more than 400 percent in less than a year. This was due to a rapid\n\nFigure 7.6  Vicor (VICR) 1990–1993\n\nVicor (VICR) sported ﬁve quarters of triple-digit EPS growth, which fueled a 460\n\npercent share price advance in 14 months.

From\nSeptember 1990 through September 1991, Vicor reported triple-digit per-\ncentage growth in its quarterly earnings. This was a tremendous perfor-\nmance that accelerated the stock price 460 percent, from a split-adjusted $4\na share to over $22. As you can see, big proﬁts can be made while earnings growth is strong;\nsome price moves are meteoric. The key is to focus on the stage 2 portion of\nthe cycle while the company is delivering strong quarterly EPS growth. Earnings Acceleration\n\nIn addition to large earnings increases that are better than analysts expect,\nI’m looking for earnings acceleration, meaning that the growth in earnings\nis larger than it was in a previous period. More than 90 percent of the big-\ngest stock market winners showed some form of earnings acceleration\nbefore or during their huge price moves. For instance, let’s say that four quarters ago the company reported a\n$0.05 decline year over year in quarterly earnings. Three quarters ago, earn-\nings were up 10 percent year over year. Then, two quarters ago, earnings were\nup 28 percent, and in the most recent quarter, results are up 56 percent. That’s\nthree quarters of earnings accelerations. Year-over-year earnings are growing\nby an increased rate sequentially, quarter to quarter. This characteristic is very\npositive and has been shown to exist in most of the best performing stocks. Figure 7.7  Example of quarterly earnings acceleration\n\nT R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\nFigure 7.8  Elan PLC (ELN) 1990\n\nIn 1990, earnings accelerated for three consecutive quarters prior to emerging\n\nas a market leader. Elan rose 152 percent in 12 months. Chart courtesy of Interactive Data © 2009. Look for Earnings Supported by Revenue\n\nIn addition to strong, accelerating earnings per share growth, you want to\nsee sales exhibit the same characteristics: strong quarterly growth and accel-\neration. It’s not uncommon for new market leaders to show triple-digit\nsales growth in the most recent two, three, or more quarters. In fact, some\ngreat stock market successes deliver large quarterly sales increases consis-\ntently for several years. For example, from March 2009 through December\n2010, Netﬂix reported eight consecutive quarters of sales increases that\naccelerated from 21 percent to 34 percent; during that period, quarterly\nearnings averaged 45 percent. Netﬂix’s stock price advanced more than 500\npercent. Home Depot made a 698 percent move from June 1982 to June\n1983. Its sales grew 104 percent, 158 percent, 191 percent, and 220 percent,\nrespectively, over the four quarters leading up to this major stock-price\n\n\fC H A P T E R   7   F U N D A M E N T A L S   T O   F O C U S   O N\n\nFigure 7.9   F5 Networks (FFIV) 2007–2011\n\nF5 Networks displayed both accelerating earnings and sales during its powerful\n\nstage 2 advance. jump. In 2010, accelerating sales bolstered earnings and propelled shares\nof F5 Networks more than 500 percent. This is what really accounts for\nsuperior stock performance: strong earnings growth backed by brisk sales,\nnot accounting gimmickry. If you demand that your stock selections not\nonly show strong earnings but also show strong sales, you will increase your\nchances of latching on to a superperformer. Check the Trend\n\nGenerally, I look back one to two years to see if there has been some form of\nearnings and sales acceleration. Life is not perfect, and so if one quarter here\nor there doesn’t accelerate, it may not be a big deal. You can smooth out\nquarterly results by using a two-quarter rolling average over the past four,\nsix, or eight quarters. Ideally, you want to see a steadily improving trend. T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\nFigure 7.10  Example of smoothing earnings and sales using a two-quarter\n\nrolling average\n\nIn contrast, a trend of a material deceleration, with results trending sharply\nlower for several quarters or longer, should raise suspicion. Annual Earnings\n\nIf a company is truly doing well, its success is unlikely to end overnight. A surprisingly good earnings report could be the beginning of a string of\nsuccessful quarters. Strong quarterly results should translate into strong\nannual results. Just one or two quarters of good earning isn’t going to be\nenough to drive a stock’s price signiﬁcantly higher for an extended period. One of the most successful stocks of the last several decades was Apollo\nGroup. From 2000 to 2004, Apollo’s stock price accelerated from $10 a share\nto $96. During that period, annual EPS growth averaged almost 40 percent,\naccelerating from 28 percent in 2000 to 55 percent in 2003. This is the type\nof growth that fuels superperformance. In addition to quarterly growth,\nlook for strong annual growth. C H A P T E R   7   F U N D A M E N T A L S   T O   F O C U S   O N\n\nFigure 7.11  Apollo Group (APOL) vs. Nasdaq with annual earnings per share\n\npercent change: 1999–2004\n\nFrom 2000 through 2003 Apollo’s earnings accelerated annually. T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\nLook for a Breakout Year\n\nYou can go back two to four years or more to a record year and see if cur-\nrent earnings are breaking out above the previous trend. It can be a fairly\nsigniﬁcant event if earnings suddenly break out to the upside from a range\nthat was established over several years. Finally, check the upcoming one or\ntwo quarters as well as the next ﬁscal year to see if earnings acceleration is\nexpected to continue. Figure 7.12  Example of an earnings breakout\n\nIn this example, 2010 earnings not only break above the previous four-year trend,\n\nbut also take out the high set in 2003. This is a signiﬁcant development. How to Spot a Turnaround Situation\n\nAnother form of earnings acceleration to look for is a turnaround situation. A stock had been doing well but then fell on hard times. During the difﬁ-\ncult period, the company probably had some negative earnings surprises, for\nexample, growing at a slower rate than expected, growing by only a single-\ndigit percentage, or perhaps reporting negative results. In some quarters,\nearnings may have declined compared with the year-ago period. Then, all of\na sudden, earnings growth explodes. The company reports quarterly earn-\nings that are up 50 percent from the prior-year period, and the next quarter\nit shows a greater than 100 percent year-over-year gain; in the subsequent\n\n\fC H A P T E R   7   F U N D A M E N T A L S   T O   F O C U S   O N\n\nquarter, results are up 150 percent. Amplifying this performance are the easy\ncomparisons from the prior year when the company was struggling. Now,\nas things start to turn around, not only is the company able to post higher\nearnings, the gains on a percentage basis look dramatically better. With turnaround situations, investors should insist that the current\nearnings be very strong (+100 percent or better in the most recent one or\ntwo quarters). If the previous results were dismal, the company should be\ndoing signiﬁcantly better percentagewise in light of easy comparisons. You\ncould also insist that earnings and margins be at or close to a new high for\nadded conﬁrmation that the company is back on track. In some cases, you can spot turnarounds and earnings acceleration by\ncomparing the current annual growth rate or current quarterly results with\nthe three- or ﬁve-year growth rate. A company that has been growing 12\npercent a year and suddenly starts to show growth of 40 percent and then\n100 percent could be a hot prospect. Figure 7.13  Example of earnings acceleration versus the three- and ﬁve-year\n\ngrowth rate\n\nQ2 and Q3 show signiﬁcant acceleration compared with the three- and ﬁve-year\n\ngrowth rates with a triple-digit gain in Q3. T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\nDeceleration Is a Red Flag\n\nA company can be doing great with high-double-digit percentage growth\nand then “deteriorate” to mid-double-digit growth. For another com-\npany, growing by 20 or 30 percent may be a big improvement. However,\nfor a company that had been growing at upward of 50 to 60 percent or\nmore, a growth rate of 20 to 30 percent would be a material deterioration. Consider what happened with Dell Computer, which from 1995 to 1997\nhad grown its earnings per share at 80 percent annually and then declined\nto around 65 percent in 1998 and 28 percent in 1999. Although this was\nstill decent growth, it was a material change and marked the end of the tre-\nmendous move in Dell’s stock price. The stock peaked in 2000. Ten years\nlater Dell’s stock price was considerably lower, down more than 80 percent\nfrom its high. Figure 7.14  Dell Computer 1995–2009\n\n\fC H A P T E R   7   F U N D A M E N T A L S   T O   F O C U S   O N\n\nHome Depot\nAfter a ﬁve-year period of stagnation that began in 1994, when Home Depot\nwas clearly in a sideways stage 1 pattern, the stock entered an acceleration\nphase in 1997. Earnings (shown on an annual basis) rose by 21 percent that\nyear, followed by an increase of 37 percent in 1998 and 41 percent in 1999. This demonstrates how a stock performs best when earnings have the stron-\ngest rate of growth. Home Depot’s stock advanced from $10 a share to a\npeak of over $70 a share. What fueled Home Depot’s price growth was an\naverage annual EPS growth rate of 27 percent, which accelerated in 1998\nand 1999. The peak for Home Depot’s stock was in 2000. After a strong earnings\nperformance in 1999 with a 41 percent growth rate, EPS momentum slowed\ndramatically. In 2000, EPS growth was only 11 percent. The deceleration\n\nFigure 7.15  Home Depot (HD) 1992–2008\n\nChart of Home Depot (HD) shows that strong, accelerating annual earnings\n\ntriggered a rapid rise in the stock price, followed by a long, precipitous decline as\n\nthe earnings growth rate slowed considerably. T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\nbrought the stock down from its lofty levels as average annual EPS growth\nfrom 2000 to 2007 was 15 percent, almost half of what it had been during the\nupward momentum phase. Home Depot shares performed poorly during\nthe slower-growth period. This was due to the stock price running up ahead\nof its earnings and then eventually falling victim to earnings deceleration,\nwhich can happen when a growth stock becomes too popular. In summary, institutions like to see the following:\n\n(cid:115)(cid:0) Earnings surprises\n\n(cid:115)(cid:0) Accelerating earnings per share (EPS) and revenues\n\n(cid:115)(cid:0) Expanding margins\n\n(cid:115)(cid:0) EPS breakout\n\n(cid:115)(cid:0) Strong annual EPS change\n\n(cid:115)(cid:0) Signs that acceleration will continue\n\n\fC H A P T E R   8\n\nAssessing\n\nEarnings Quality\n\nA company can generate earnings in various ways, some not so\n\ntrustworthy; I prefer high-quality earnings. In other words, where\ndid the earnings come from? Did the company post better results because of\nstronger sales? If sales were strong, was it only because of a single product or\none major customer? In that case, the growth is vulnerable. Or are the sur-\nprisingly strong results due to an industrywide phenomenon or an inﬂux\nof orders from numerous buyers? Maybe the company is slashing costs and\ncutting back. Earnings improvement from cost cutting, plant closures,\nand other so-called productivity enhancements walks on short legs. Such\nimprovements can show up from time to time, but sustainable earnings\ngrowth requires revenue growth. Examining earnings quality gives you\nperspective and rationale before you commit your hard-earned money to\na stock. Nonoperating or Nonrecurring Income\n\nDepending  on  how  you  examine  a  company’s  quarterly  report,  it  can\nlook like a roaring success or a sagging sloth; it’s all a matter of perspec-\ntive.

(cid:115)(cid:0) What is the company doing to increase revenue and expand\n\nmargins? (cid:115)(cid:0) What is the company doing to decrease costs and increase\n\nproductivity? Measuring Margins\n\nThe objective for any company is to retain as much money as it can from the\nrevenue it generates, meaning that it has the highest proﬁt margin possible. When margins expand, the company is getting a higher price for its prod-\nucts or has found a way to improve productivity or cut expenses, sometimes\nboth. Increasing margins show that more proﬁts are being made for each\ndollar of sales the company makes. Margin metrics come in different varieties. Gross margin reﬂects how\nmuch more customers pay for a product compared with the company’s\ncosts. It shows investors how well a company is doing in keeping its costs\nin line and pricing its products. Gross margins depend on quite a few vari-\nables, some of which may be beyond the company’s control, for example,\nif raw material costs were lower one quarter or if a competitor had a deliv-\nery problem that gave the company an unexpected advantage that could be\na short-lived phenomenon. The best kind of margin improvement comes\nfrom pricing power because of strong demand for a company’s products. Net margin is based on a company’s net income divided by sales and\nreﬂects all the variables that inﬂuence proﬁtability. A falling net margin\nindicates that the company is making a smaller proﬁt on its sales. This could\nbe due to rising costs, inefﬁciencies, or taxation. Margin pressure can cause\nserious proﬁt erosion. The cause of a decline in net margins could be tem-\nporary in nature, such as a short-term rise in raw material costs or tempo-\nrary inefﬁciency in the production system. Far more worrisome is when the\nnet margin declines because prices are dropping as a result of declining cus-\ntomer interest. Figure 8.2  Apple Computer (AAPL) 2003–2011\nFrom 2003 to 2011 Apple Computer’s stock price advanced more than 6,000\npercent.

A comparison of net margin across\ncompanies in an industry can be used to gauge the quality of management. A well-run growth company should show consistent improvement in oper-\nating margins and net proﬁt margins. Where the Rubber Meets the Road\n\nNo matter how good an earnings report appears to be on the surface, you\nwant to pay close attention to the stock’s price reaction to determine how\ngood the report really was or was perceived to be. One way to do this is sim-\nply to watch how the stock trades initially and over subsequent days after\nthe earnings release. If the report really was great, you should see a strong\nstock price reaction that holds up and is supported by additional buying on\nreasonable pullbacks. I like to see the stock price react strongly to the report\nand hold its gains. To determine whether the market is looking favorably on a company’s\n\nearnings, I watch for three speciﬁc reactions:\n\n1. Initial response. Did the stock rally or experience a sell-off?

Even if you miss the ﬁrst\nupward reaction after results are reported, the postearnings drift after a sig-\nniﬁcant surprise can last for some time. Stock price movements from signiﬁ-\ncant earnings surprises not only are felt right way but can have a longer-term\neffect beyond the immediate price adjustments. Many studies have shown\nthat the effect can persist for months after an earnings announcement. Sometimes earnings are largely discounted, meaning that expectations\nfor an earnings surprise were already priced in. Because such high expecta-\n\nFigure 8.4  Lululemon Athetica Inc. (LULU) 2011–2011\nLululemon experienced post earnings drift (PED) after reporting earnings in\nSeptember and December 2010. C H A P T E R   8   A S S E S S I N G   E A R N I N G S   Q U A L I T Y\n\ntions had been discounted in the stock price, even an earnings surprise will\nnot satisfy the market. If earnings came in at, say, $0.05 a share over expecta-\ntions but that level of outperformance was already anticipated, this will be a\ndisappointment to the market, which had hoped for an even bigger surprise,\nsay, $0.07 or $0.10 a share. Even if the consensus was $0.50 and the com-\npany reported $0.55 a share, the stock could sell off because earnings did not\ncome in even higher. How do you know what the market wants other than the published\nestimates? Study how the stock price responds. Was the stock rewarded\nor punished when the results came in? Was an upside surprise big enough\nto move share prices higher, or did the stock sell off? Even if an earnings\nreport appears to be a surprise, you can judge the true perception only\nfrom the response of the share price. Unexpected surprises can have a dra-\nmatic effect.

These comments are also known\nas forward-looking statements and generally focus on earnings, sales, and\nmargin expectations. Company guidance is given so that investors can eval-\nuate the company’s growth potential. Under current regulations, it is the\nonly legal way a company can communicate its expectations to the market. Analysts use this information in combination with their own research to\ndevelop earnings forecasts. Company-issued guidance plays an important role in the investment\ndecision process because management knows its business better than any-\none else and has ﬁrsthand information on which to base its expectations. Be\naware, however, that management can use guidance to sway investors. For\nexample, in a bull market some companies have given optimistic forecasts\nbecause the market wants momentum stocks with fast-growing earnings per\nshare. In bear markets, companies have tried to guide expectations lower so\nthat they can beat the earnings projections. Companies generally issue guidance at or near the time a quarterly\nearnings report is released. Let’s say that along with reporting stronger than\nexpected earnings, the company issues guidance for the upcoming quarter\nand the rest of the year, projecting much better earnings ahead. For exam-\nple, the company may say that for the next quarter it expects to earn $0.10\nto $0.12 a share more than it previously predicted, and it also increases the\nexpectation for year-end results by $0.30 to $0.35 a share. Not only has the\ncompany beaten the expectations for this quarter, it feels conﬁdent enough\nthat it will have good results the next quarter to go public with a statement\nto that effect. Because companies are conservative about their earnings\nguidance, we know that a statement like this won’t be issued unless manage-\nment thinks the results will not only meet these higher expectations but also\nbeat them. This is exactly what I’m looking for: better than expected earn-\nings along with positive earnings guidance. A company should not only be\ndoing well but be doing better than analysts anticipate. Depending on what a company says about its business prospects going\nforward, positive or negative, the response of the stock price could be dra-\n\n\fC H A P T E R   8   A S S E S S I N G   E A R N I N G S   Q U A L I T Y\n\nmatic. In some cases, the reaction to earnings guidance is stronger than\nthe reaction to the actual earnings report when it is announced. By track-\ning what a company says and then what develops later on, you can ascertain\nthe quality and tendencies of the company’s guidance. If you think earnings expectations don’t drive stock prices, watch what\nhappens when a company announces earnings that fall short of expecta-\ntions even by just a few pennies or when it issues downside guidance. Rosetta\nStone Inc. (RST) raised its guidance for third-quarter and ﬁscal 2009 results\nin July 2009. After a brief pullback, four days after guidance was raised, the\nstock sold off and could not rally and recover. This was abnormal consider-\ning the rosy guidance. Just days later the company ﬂip-ﬂopped and issued\nlower guidance, and the stock got blasted. It simply did not make sense that\nthe stock broke down and couldn’t rally after what should have been per-\nceived as great news. This was telling of the future. The fact that the com-\n\nFigure 8.6  Rosetta Stone (RST) 2009–2010\nRosetta Stone shares were propelled higher when the company raised its\nearnings outlook. Eleven trading days later, the stock sold off sharply when the\ncompany unexpectedly lowered its guidance.

As you can see from the previous Rosetta Stone example, company\nissued guidance can send a stock soaring or plummeting depending on\nhow it is perceived by investors. In February of 2003, Dick’s Sporting Goods\n(DKS) gapped up big after the company issued positive forward guidance. The overwhelming volume was revealing; a telltale sign that institutions\ntook comfort from the news. Long-Term Projections\n\nWhen obliged to fess up to bad news, a publicly traded company will often\ntry to spin the message. It may announce a stock buyback or some other\n“positive” news at the same time it reports a disappointing quarter in an\neffort to soften the blow and offset any potential negative effects. This gener-\n\n\fC H A P T E R   8   A S S E S S I N G   E A R N I N G S   Q U A L I T Y\n\nally doesn’t work. One feeble tactic is to issue an upbeat long-term projec-\ntion at the same time they deliver bad news about an upcoming or current\nquarter. In dealing with future earnings, it’s important not to look too far\nout. Growth investors tend to have a “what have you done for me lately”\nmentality. Therefore, focus on what the company is saying about the upcom-\ning quarter and the current ﬁscal year. My rule of thumb is to take long-term\nforecasts with a grain of salt. No one, not even management, can accurately\nforecast what a company will earn or what its rate of growth will be a year\nor two down the road. If they say, “Business conditions will be tough this\nyear, but we see improvement coming next year,” that’s not positive guid-\nance. That’s spin. Analyzing Inventories\n\nBack when I ﬁrst started trading stocks in the early 1980s, public companies\nwere not required to report inventory ﬁgures; now those ﬁgures are readily\navailable. Inventory ﬁgures can be found in the published balance sheets of\na corporation, which are available in 10-Q (quarterly) and 10-K (annual)\nﬁlings to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Companies post\nthe ﬁlings on their websites; corporate ﬁlings also are available on the SEC’s\nEDGAR database. With a manufacturer or retailer, inventory and accounts receivable\nanalyses can provide a heads-up as to whether business conditions are likely\nto improve or if the good times are coming to an end. In late 2003–2004, the\nprice of copper was going through the roof. This rapid escalation in the price\nof a raw material, I knew, would enable manufacturers of copper products\nto pass along a price increase to customers. By examining the inventory ﬁgures in the quarterly reports of several\nmanufacturers, I found my candidate: Encore Wire (WIRE). Encore pos-\nsessed signiﬁcant copper inventories and met the criteria of my SEPA stock\nanalysis. I knew I had a potential big winner in sight. Encore had a stockpile\nof copper it had bought at lower prices. With the price of copper signiﬁ-\ncantly higher, Encore could charge its customers signiﬁcantly higher prices\nthan it paid, which accounted for expanding proﬁt margins. T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\nFigure 8.8  Price of copper and Encore Wire (WIRE) 2003–2006\nA stockpile of copper bought at lower prices allowed Encore Wire signiﬁcant\nmargin expansion. Compare Inventory with Sales\n\nFor certain industries, such as manufacturing, the comparison of inventory\nand sales is crucial. Speciﬁcally, I look at the breakdown of inventory (i.e.,\nﬁnished goods, work in progress, and raw materials) and how each segment\nrelates to the others. The inventory breakdown also helps put sales in per-\nspective. For example, a strong gain in sales may look impressive; however,\nthe company could be pushing on a string if in fact inventories are growing\nmuch faster than sales. If the ﬁnished goods portion of inventories is rising\nmuch more rapidly than the raw materials or work-in-progress segments,\nthis could mean that product is piling up. Therefore, production will slow\nbecause the company already has a stockpile of ﬁnished goods. C H A P T E R   8   A S S E S S I N G   E A R N I N G S   Q U A L I T Y\n\nIf that inventory of ﬁnished products is highly depreciable—such as\ncomputers and certain retail goods—this could spell trouble ahead. A com-\npany sitting on a large stock of depreciating merchandise will have to slash\nprices to get rid of it. Also, that aging inventory will compete in the mar-\nketplace with newer product lines. Higher-trending inventories can lead to\nmarkdowns and write-offs, a scenario ripe for a hit on future earnings, caus-\ning the company to report a disappointing quarter. Keep in mind that the amount of inventory by itself is not that mean-\ningful to your analysis. It’s the trend in inventories versus sales and the per-\ncentage increase or decrease within the inventory chain that yield valuable\ninformation. Think of inventory as merchandise waiting to be sold. Under most con-\nditions, inventories should rise and fall in a pattern similar to that for sales. Management tries to anticipate future sales and stocks inventory to meet\ndemand or expected demand. When inventory grows much faster than sales,\nit can indicate weakening sales, misjudgment by management of future\ndemand, or both. These scenarios are likely to undermine earnings. The more\nrapidly inventory depreciates, the more excess inventory will be detrimental. Dell’s Solution for Inventory Buildup\nCompanies that control their inventory the best in an environment of fall-\ning prices have the potential to hold up best and outperform the others,\nespecially during an economic downturn. Dell Computer responded to this\nproblem with its revolutionary “build-to-order” business model. The model\ntransformed the manufacturing business by lowering inventory stockpiles\nand decreasing the risk of holding depreciating computers. Other compa-\nnies have since adopted this simple concept even in industries outside the\ncomputer business. Dell’s model is based on orders taken over the phone\nand on its website. Computers are not put into production until an order\nis placed. This dramatically reduced the number of days inventory was held\nand increased the company’s inventory turnover ratio to more than three\ntimes that of its rivals. This unique new business model allowed Dell to capture higher proﬁt\nmargins than its competitors, gain market share, and dominate the com-\n\nT R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\nputer market during the 1990s. The reason this concept worked so well in\nthe computer business is that the product was highly depreciable. Virtually\nall of Dell’s competitors relied on a business model that involved stock-\ning retail stores with merchandise. When business turned down, Dell’s\ncompetitors  were  holding  large  inventories  of  merchandise,  the  value\nof which was eroding with time and advances in computer performance\nand capabilities. To keep their merchandise from spoiling like fruit in the\nsun, Compaq, Hewlett-Packard, and Gateway were forced to cut prices to\nunload their stockpiles. This condition will often show up in inventories,\nwith ﬁnished goods usually rising and trending upward faster than sales\nand raw materials. Not all inventory buildups are bad. Maybe a company has to ﬁll the\nshelves of 20 new stores it just opened. The real red ﬂag arises when an\ninventory buildup is unexplained or the explanation isn’t a good one. If you\nspot an unexplained inventory buildup, you can call the company or go on\nan investor conference call to ask for an explanation. On the ﬂip side, if raw materials are suddenly building up, this could\nbe an indication that the company believes business will be picking up. If\nthat’s the case, sales should show signs of acceleration shortly afterward to\nconﬁrm that the raw material buildup was indeed in anticipation of stron-\nger demand. Analyzing Receivables\n\nIn addition to inventories, a part of a company’s balance sheet that mer-\nits attention is receivables. Accounts receivable are what the company is\nowed for sales it has already made. Some receivables are to be expected in\nthe course of doing business; it’s normal to have a reasonable delay between\ndelivery of products or services and receipt of payment. However, if receiv-\nables are increasing at a far greater rate than sales or if the trend is accelerat-\ning, this could be a warning that the company is having trouble collecting\nfrom its customers. If receivables and inventories are both increasing at a greater rate than\nsales (twice or more without explanation), this could be double trouble. C H A P T E R   8   A S S E S S I N G   E A R N I N G S   Q U A L I T Y\n\nThink about it. We know from the previous discussion that when invento-\nries—particularly of ﬁnished goods—rise faster than sales, that means prod-\nuct is building up. The company has made more than it can sell in current\nmarket conditions, assuming that there isn’t a good reason for the buildup,\nsuch as the need to stock new retail outlets. This is even a bigger problem if\nthe inventory stockpile is of highly depreciable goods. When receivables are\nalso rising, the company hasn’t been paid for what it has sold to its custom-\ners. This is a double whammy that often forecasts trouble ahead: Consumers\naren’t buying, and retailers aren’t selling and therefore aren’t able to pay for\nthe product they’ve got. The manufacturer isn’t collecting on what it sold,\nand its warehouses are full of more product than it can ship. There could be a reasonable explanation for the rising receivables, such\nas a new product line or new customers in a different industry that have\nbeen given longer credit terms. Maybe orders have not shipped as expected\nbecause of a production delay. Whatever the reason, it’s worth investigating\nto see if this is a red ﬂag or a situation that’s easily explained. In the example below, the rate of increase in total inventories is four\ntimes that of sales and receivables are up three times the rate of sales. More\ntroubling is the fact that ﬁnished goods and work in progress are up big\nrelative to raw materials. This could indicate an unusually large stockpile of\ngoods. To the extent that those goods are depreciable, the product on hand\nwill be worth less and less as time goes by, eroding margins and ultimately\nearnings. This type of scenario should raise a red ﬂag. Figure 8.9  Red ﬂag scenario\nExample of an inventory buildup with ﬁnished goods and receivables growing at\na rate faster than sales.

Hitting on All Cylinders: The Code 33\n\nWhen a company grows its sales at an accelerating rate (25 percent, then\n35 percent, then 45 percent, and so on), this is great. Better still, though, is\na company that accelerates its sales and expands its proﬁt margins at the\nsame time. This powerful combination can ignite earnings and fuel explo-\nsive stock price appreciation. The result is a condition in which the company\ncan grow its earnings at a much faster rate than it could if sales or margins\nwere accelerating only by themselves or if neither were accelerating. The best\nsituation for rapid earnings growth is to be hitting on all cylinders as sales\naccelerate and proﬁt margins expand simultaneously. Look for what I call a Code 33 situation, three quarters of acceleration in\nearnings, sales, and proﬁt margins. That’s a potent recipe.

C H A P T E R   9\n\nFollow the Leaders\n\nM ost  of  the  big  money made in bull markets comes in the\n\nearly stages, during the ﬁrst 12 to 18 months. However, by the\ntime a big advance asserts itself in the broad market indexes, many of the\nbest stocks may have been running up for weeks in advance. The question\nthen becomes how you know when to jump on board before an emerging\nrally gets away from you and the very best stocks leave you in the dust. The\nanswer: follow the leaders. Top-performing stocks will lead the broader market averages at impor-\ntant turning points. As a bear market is bottoming, leading stocks, the ones\nthat best resisted the decline, will turn up ﬁrst and then sprint ahead—days,\nweeks, or even months before the Dow, S&P, and Nasdaq indexes put on\ntheir running shoes. These leading names will break into new high ground\nwhile the major indexes are just starting to come off their respective lows. At\nthis point, overall market conditions still look bleak to most investors and\nthe news is still for the most part negative and cautionary. Later, the rally\nbroadens, pushing up the indexes, which propels the front-runners even\nhigher. Then sentiment begins to shift from fear to optimism. By paying\nclose attention to the market’s leading names, you can be in the best stocks\nbefore they are obvious to the public. This is nothing new to astute stock\ninvestors who know what to look for. The legendary Jesse Livermore built\nhis fortune by trading in leading stocks in the 1920s and 1930s. I made 99\npercent of my proﬁts in the stock market by trading in leading names. Market leaders tend to foretell turns to the downside as well. As a bull\nmarket enters its later stages (generally after one or two years), many of the\n\nT R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\nleadership stocks that led the market advance will start to buckle while the\nbroad market averages march on toward their tops. Typically, a second wave\nof postleadership stocks start to perform relatively well as money rotates\nout of the true leaders and into some of the group’s constituents, laggard\nfollow-up stocks, or defensive groups such as drugs, tobacco, utilities, and\nfood stocks that are thought to be less sensitive to an economic downturn. Follow-on stocks and laggards, however, rarely experience the length or,\nmore important, the magnitude of the price move that true market leaders\naccomplish. When you see this rotation occurring, it’s a warning that the\nmarket rally may be entering its later stage. The ultimate market top may\nstill be weeks or even months away, but this internal market action is a pro-\nverbial shot across the bow that should get your attention. Getting in Sync\n\nThe problem for most investors is that they fail to notice the important\nnuances and clues from leading stocks near turning points, and that causes\nthem to lose perspective. Why? Investors are gun-shy after the market has\nbeen declining steadily. Just about the time the market is bottoming, most\ninvestors have already suffered large losses in their portfolios because they\nrefused to cut their losses short. After a market correction, many investors\nare busy hoping to break even on the open losses they hold or are convinced\nthat the end of the world is coming because they got crushed during the pre-\nvious decline and refuse to acknowledge the buy signals individual leading\nstocks are offering. Making it even more difﬁcult is the fact that leading stocks always\nappear to be too high or too expensive to most investors. Market leaders are\nthe stocks that emerge ﬁrst and hit the 52-week-high list just as the market is\nstarting to turn up. Few investors buy stocks near new highs, and fewer buy\nthem at the correct time. They focus on the market instead of the individual\nmarket leaders and often end up buying late and owning laggards. Adding\nto the distraction is the fact that the news media are usually wrong at major\nturning points. At a market bottom they’ll predict the end of the world, and\nat a top the same people will say you can’t go wrong investing in stocks. It\ncan be very confusing if you listen to what people are saying instead of pay-\n\n\fC H A P T E R   9   F O L L O W   T H E   L E A D E R S\n\nFigure 9.1  Pharmacyclics, Inc.

More than 90 percent of\nsuperperformance stocks emerge from bear markets and general market\ncorrections. The key is to do your homework while the market is down;\nthen you will be prepared to make big proﬁts when it turns up. On February 4, 2010, I purchased Pharmacyclics Inc. (PCYC), and also\nrecommended it to our Minervini Private Access clients; this was a day\nwhen the Nasdaq Composite Index was hitting a new low. Over the next 48\ntrading days, PCYC advanced 90 percent, during which time the Nasdaq\nrallied only about 18 percent. The 90 percent advance proved to be only the\nbeginning; PCYC advanced 1,500 percent in 33 months, a clear example of\nmarket leadership. The Lockout\nDuring the ﬁrst few months of a new bull market you should see multiple\nwaves of stocks emerging into new high ground; general market pullbacks\nwill be minimal and probably will be contained to 3 to 5 percent from peak\nto trough. Many inexperienced investors will be looking to buy a pullback\nthat rarely materializes during the initial leg of a new powerful bull market,\nwhich from the onset will appear to be overbought. Typically, the early phase of a move off an important bottom has the\ncharacteristics of a lockout rally. During this lockout period, investors wait\nfor an opportunity to enter the market on a pullback, but that pullback\nnever comes. Instead, demand is so strong that the market moves steadily\nhigher, ignoring overbought readings. As a result, investors are essentially\nlocked out of the market. If the major market indexes ignore an extremely\noverbought condition after a bear market decline and your list of leaders\nexpands, this should be viewed as a sign of strength. To determine if the\nrally is real, up days should be accompanied by increased volume whereas\ndown days or pullbacks have lower overall market volume. More important,\nthe price action of leading stocks should be studied to determine if there are\nstocks emerging from sound, buyable bases. Additional conﬁrmation is given when the list of stocks making new\n52-week highs outpaces the new 52-week low list and starts to expand sig-\nniﬁcantly. At this point, you should raise your exposure in accordance with\n\n\fC H A P T E R   9   F O L L O W   T H E   L E A D E R S\n\nyour trading criteria on a stock-by-stock basis. As the adage goes, “It’s a\nmarket of stocks, not a stock market.” In the early stages of a market-bottom\nrally it’s absolutely critical to focus on leading stocks if your goal is to latch\non to big winners. Sometimes you will be early. Stick with a stop-loss disci-\npline, and if the rally is for real, the majority of the leading stocks will hold\nup well and you will have to make only a few adjustments. However, if you\nget stopped out repeatedly, you may be too early. The Best Stocks Make Their Lows First\n\nTo make big money in the stock market, you’re going to need to have the\noverall stock market’s primary trend on your side. A strong market trend\nis not something you want to go against. However, if you concentrate on\nthe general market solely for timing your individual stock purchases, you’re\nlikely to miss many of the really great selections as they emerge at or close to\na market bottom. The true market leaders will show strong relative price strength before\nthey advance. Such stocks have low correlation with the general market\naverages and very often act as lone wolves during their biggest advancing\nstage. The search for these stocks runs contrary to the thinking of most\ninvestors, who often take a top-down approach, examining ﬁrst the econ-\nomy and the stock market, then market sectors, and ﬁnally companies in a\nspeciﬁc industry group. As I’ll show you in several examples in this chap-\nter, many of the very best leading stocks tend to bottom and top ahead of\ntheir respective sectors, whereas speciﬁc industry groups can lead a gen-\neral market turn. Although it’s true that many of the market’s biggest\nwinners are part of industry group moves, in my experience, often by\nthe time it’s obvious that the underlying sector is hot, the real industry\nleaders—the very best of the breed—have already moved up dramati-\ncally in price. In the early stage of a relative strength leader’s uptrend, there may or\nmay not be much conﬁrming price strength from its group overall. This is\nnormal. Often there will be only one or two other stocks in the group dis-\nplaying strong relative strength. Therefore, it requires additional skill to pin-\n\nT R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\nFigure 9.2  Leading stocks versus respective sector and lagged “follow-up\n\neffect”\nTheoretical cycle dynamics shows the leaders, the overall sector, and the\nlaggards during a bull market and then entering a bear market phase. point these stocks early on. As the leader’s trend continues to advance and\neventually its industry group and sector begin to show signs of strength, the\nprice advance of the market leader will do one of two things: it will continue\nits advance while the group propels it even higher, or it will consolidate in\na sideways fashion and digest its previous gains while the group and other\nstocks in the group play catch-up. This does not necessarily mean that the\nleader’s price advance has ended, because leaders can zig while the market\nzags; this is typical of high alpha stocks. You should look for deﬁnite signs\nthat the stock has topped before concluding that the move is over. Your Window of  Opportunity\n\nMarket leaders are the stocks that can increase the value of a portfolio signif-\nicantly and rapidly, the types of stocks that can produce superperformance. By applying a bottom-up approach to ﬁnd the best relative performers in\nthe early stages of a bull market, you will put yourself in a position to latch\n\n\fC H A P T E R   9   F O L L O W   T H E   L E A D E R S\n\non to some really big winners. The stocks that hold up the best and rally\ninto new high ground off the market low during the ﬁrst 4 to 8 weeks of a\nnew bull market are the true market leaders, capable of advancing signiﬁ-\ncantly. You can’t afford to ignore these golden opportunities. There are countless examples of market leaders that displayed obvious\nsigns of strength before there was a widespread indication of overall mar-\nket or industry group strength. It’s a matter of knowing what to look for. For example, in 2001, Amazon bottomed well ahead of the market and gave\ninvestors a year to prepare for the eventual buy point that propelled the\nstock 240 percent in 12 months. Figure 9.3  Amazon (AMZN) vs. the Nasdaq Composite Index, 2001–2003\nAmazon (AMZN) turned into a stage 2 uptrend well in advance of the general\nmarket, giving investors ample time to prepare for the buy point, which preceded\na 240 percent advance in only 12 months. T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\nMarket leaders tend to stand out best during an intermediate market\ncorrection or in the later stages of a bear market. Look for resilient stocks\nthat hold up the best, rebound the fastest, and gain the most percentage-\nwise off the general market bottom. This, too, will identify potential leading\nnames. After an extended bear market correction, look for stocks that hold\ntheir ground or, even better, work their way higher while the general mar-\nket averages trend lower. A series of higher lows during lower lows in the\ngeneral averages is a tip-off that a potential market leader is in the making. The relative strength line of the stock should show steady improvement as\nthe market declines. It’s important to study carefully the price action of\nindividual companies with new positive developments and strong earn-\nings per share during major market declines. Many of the most strongly\nrebounding stocks and the ones that hold up the best are likely to become\nthe next up cycle’s superperformers. Superperformance can be triggered by several factors, including a posi-\ntive earnings surprise, industrywide regulatory change, governmental policy\nchange, newly awarded contracts, better than anticipated results from a new\nproduct launch, and the planned introduction of a unique new product. For\na pharmaceutical or biotech company, U.S. Food and Drug Administration\napproval for a promising new drug or medical device can have an enor-\nmously positive effect. On July 20, 2009, shares of the small biopharma\ncompany Human Genome Sciences (HGSI) soared, closing up more than\n270 percent in just one day, but that was only the beginning. The company\nunveiled test results on a drug that could become the ﬁrst new treatment for\nlupus in 50 years, a drug with truly revolutionary potential. Seven months\nlater, HGSI’s stock price was up an additional 165 percent. Similarly, on\nApril 14, 2009, shares of Dendreon Corp soared almost 200 percent after the\ncompany said its prostate cancer vaccine Provenge signiﬁcantly prolonged\nthe overall survival of patients compared with a placebo. Eleven months\nlater, the stock price was up an additional 117 percent. There was a stark contrast between Humana’s stock price trend and\nthe general market price action from June 1977 to August 1978. Humana’s\nstock had been in a stage 2 uptrend and was hitting a new high while the\nDow had not even turned the corner yet.

Emulex\nIn 2001, I bought shares of Emulex (EMEX). The stock attracted my atten-\ntion for several reasons. First, as the general market was near a new low,\nEmulex shot up 100 percent in only one week. This impressive strength was\nthe initial tip-off that something big was about to happen with the stock. Such a surge in demand is often a reaction to a positive development that\nhas recently surprised the Street or an indication that something is being\nanticipated. Next,  the  stock  pulled  back  sharply,  but  it  recovered  very\nquickly in only a few days. The stock gave up little ground afterward.

I bought W.R. Grace & Co. (GRA) on August 26, 2004, while the Nasdaq\nComposite was just starting to rally off its correction low on the ninth day. The stock ran up more than 40 percent in 13 days. Forty-four days later,\nGRA was up 110 percent. The Nasdaq Composite Index during that period\nwas up only 10 percent. Figure 9.7  WR Grace & Co.

These stocks may beneﬁt from strong earnings and\nsales, new products or services, or industry changes that positively affect\nthe company. However, a stock’s price trend may be temporarily held back\nor muted by the weight of the bearish primary trend of the general mar-\nket. This causes a stock’s price to decline, but not as severely as the prices of\nother stocks. These stocks are generally very resilient and bounce back into\nnew high ground quickly off their lows. When the bearish market exhausts\nitself and turns up, stocks in their own earnings up cycle will blast off and\nadvance signiﬁcantly, in some cases for an extended period. On the ﬂip side,\nstocks that are in their own bearish cycle may resist even a strong market\nand go nowhere. Often this is an indication of an unfavorable outlook, and\nthese stocks should be avoided. Panera Bread (PNRA) advanced an incredible 1,100 percent over 26\nmonths during one of the most devastating bear markets in U.S. stock mar-\nket history. The Nasdaq Composite, meanwhile, declined approximately 80\npercent in that period. This does not mean that you should focus on buying\nstocks during major declines in the overall market; Panera Bread is clearly\nnot the norm.

C H A P T E R   9   F O L L O W   T H E   L E A D E R S\n\nA Classic Case of  Market Leadership\n\nDuring the entire 1990 bear market, I observed that Amgen’s stock price\nbarely dropped below its 50-day moving average for any length of time. As\nthe market continued in a precipitous downtrend, Amgen moved sideways\nand marked time. This is how a stock can improve its relative strength rank-\ning during a market correction even without the stock rallying very much. Figure 9.9  Amgen (AMGN) vs. the Nasdaq Composite Index, 1990\nAmgen held up exceptionally well and displayed strong relative strength while the\noverall market was declining. T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\nEvery time the Dow rallied off its lower lows, Amgen would edge its way into\nnew high ground; this got my attention. Finally, in October 1990, the market\nreached a bottom. Only 22 days later Amgen hit an all-time price high. The\nNasdaq Composite and other popular averages were still 25 percent off their\nhighs. The market indexes, however, did not discourage me. I started to buy\nstocks in the healthcare group that were displaying the best earnings and\nprice strength. The broader market had been sitting on the stock through-\nout its correction; however, once the market took off the pressure, Amgen\ntook off. It was one of the ﬁrst stocks to emerge in the 1990 bull market and\ngained 360 percent in just 14 months,. Look for a Technical Theme\n\nEach market cycle has a unique signature in the form of the price and vol-\nume action in leading names. Often a similar technical theme will be pres-\nent. A growing number of stocks displaying positive, divergent price\nbehavior during a general market decline can tip you off to where the next\ngroup of market leaders may emerge or what stocks are likely to blast off\nﬁrst when the market starts to rally. When you see this type of price action,\nit’s time to tune out the media and the gurus and concentrate on the facts:\nprice, volume, earnings, sales, proﬁt margins, new products, and positive\nindustry changes. Look for the evidence stock by stock and employ the best\ncriteria. Most of the time there will be more than just one stock in a particu-\nlar industry group displaying this type of behavior. You should try to own\nthe top one, two, or three names in the industry in terms of relative perfor-\nmance and earnings power. Look for the types of patterns and price action\nthat are proliferating in the marketplace. This can help you understand what\ntype of tactic will work best in the current cycle. In 1990, medical-related stocks were emerging as market leaders one\nafter the other. Stocks such as US Surgical, United Healthcare, Amgen,\nBallard Medical Products, and Stryker, among others, were leading the mar-\nket. For many of these stocks, their relative price strength during the 1990\nbear market proved to be a valuable tip-off that they were about to lead the\nnext bull run and score huge returns for investors. I know. I was there at the\ntime, buying them as they emerged. C H A P T E R   9   F O L L O W   T H E   L E A D E R S\n\nAlso emerging from the 1990 bear market bottom was the market leader\nAmerican Power Conversion (APCC). Like Amgen, this company caught my\nattention, and for similar reasons: a stock that was starting to go higher as soon\nas the market took off the brake. Founded by a group of engineers from MIT,\nAPCC had set out to develop solar power products, but after sharp declines\nin oil prices and muted government support for solar power, the company\nquickly shifted to developing uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems for\ncomputers and workstations. The timing was perfect. APCC introduced its\nﬁrst UPS models in 1984 just as the microcomputer market began to blast off. In 1991, APCC introduced models that sold for under $200, which opened up\nthe home PC market for the ﬁrst time. The rest is history. It was no coincidence that APCC’s stock price emerged off the 1990\nbear market low into new high ground on the exact day that Amgen did\n(22 days into the rally). The two stocks displayed nearly identical price\n\nFigure 9.10  American Power Conversion (APCC) vs. the Nasdaq Composite\n\nIndex, 1990\nAmerican Power Conversion emerged as the market was bottoming and then\ngained 4,100 percent in 50 months.

Selling for its highest price\never on November 12, 1990, proved to be only the tip of the iceberg. APCC\nadvanced a whopping 4,100 percent over the subsequent 50 months. Which Leaders Should I Buy First? As you shift into buying gear, the question becomes, Which stocks should I\nbuy ﬁrst? It’s simple. Buy the strongest ﬁrst. Coming off a market low, I like\nto buy in order of breakout. The best selections in your lineup will be the\nﬁrst to burst forth and emerge from a proper buy point and into new high\nground. The ones that act the strongest are generally the best choices at this\npoint. Let the strength of the market tell you where to put your money, not\nyour personal opinion, which rarely is a good substitute for the wisdom\nof the market. Ultimately, opinions mean nothing compared with the ver-\ndict of the market. The stocks that emerge ﬁrst in the early stage of a new\nbull market with the greatest power are generally the best candidates for\nsuperperformance. At the August 2007 low, oversold conditions dominated many market-\ntiming indicators, which were down to levels equivalent to the 2002 and\n2004 market bottoms. Most important and what caught my attention was\nthe fact that an increasing number of fundamentally strong companies were\nemerging from sound consolidation patterns. New stock breakouts were\nboosting some industry sectors out of oversold levels. Adding to my bullish view was the fact that the previous weeks included\npositive key reversals in the major averages, an improvement in advisory\nsentiment and put/call ratios, and very impressive up/down volume ratios\n\nThere was still a distinct possibility that the market could be hit with an\nadditional wave of selling, which would force another leg down in the major\naverages. Nonetheless, I started adding many of the best names to my buy\nlist and covered all my short positions. My thinking was that even if the mar-\nket did sell off again, many of my stops on my longs would probably not be\nviolated. If they were, I would simply sell and cut my losses. C H A P T E R   9   F O L L O W   T H E   L E A D E R S\n\nWhen a market is bottoming, the best stocks make their lows ahead\nof the absolute low in the market averages. As the broader market aver-\nages make lower lows during the last leg down, the leaders diverge and\nmake higher lows. It’s  important  to  watch  very  carefully  at  this  junc-\nture and stand ready to cut your losses if volatility widens too much in\nyour individual holdings. If more leaders emerge and the overall market\nstrengthens, be ready move to an even more aggressive long bias. As the following examples show, your objective is to look for the stocks\nthat hold up the best—either declining the least or even moving somewhat\nhigher—during bear markets.

The smart money that moved into those\nstocks ahead of the curve will move out swiftly at the ﬁrst hint of slowing\ngrowth. When the leading names in leading industry groups start to falter\nafter an extended market run, this is a danger signal that should heighten\nyour attention to the more speciﬁc signs of market trouble or possible trou-\nble in a particular sector. Most stocks experience a relatively severe decline in price after a super-\nperformance phase has run its course. This is due to proﬁt taking and the\nanticipation of slower growth ahead. Scientiﬁc evidence and my personal\nexperience indicate that the chances of a superperformer giving back most\nor all of its gains are high. You must have a plan to sell and nail down prof-\nits when you have them. History shows that one-third of superpeformers\ngive back all or more of their entire advance. On average, their subsequent\nprice declines are 50 to 70 percent, depending on the period measured. In a post-bubble-type market such as 1929–1930s and 2000–2003, many\nleading stocks declined as much as 80 to 90 percent. This is not the type of\ndecline from which a stock investor can recover.

Therefore, if history is any guide, the leaders of\none cycle should generally be abandoned as buy candidates both for bear\nmarket recovery rallies and for the next bull market. There is one caveat to\nthis: if the leadership stocks or sectors started to emerge near the end of the\nbull market cycle preceding the subsequent bear market, in some cases they\ncan lead during the bull market. One thing for certain is that very often the\nleaders of the next bull market will emerge from the most unlikely areas but\nquickly reveal themselves through the application of the price analysis tech-\nniques discussed in this chapter. Follow the leaders and you will participate\nin and proﬁt from many of the most exciting entrepreneurial companies\nthis country has to offer. Learn to Buy Leaders and Avoid Laggards\n\nAs a general rule, I buy strength, not weakness. True market leaders will\nalways show improving relative strength, in particular during a market cor-\nrection. You should update your watch list on a frequent basis, weeding\nout issues that give up too much price and adding through forced displace-\nment new potential buy candidates that show divergence and resilience. In\naddition to keeping your lineup of candidate buys current, this practice will\nsharpen your feel for the overall health and quality of the market and keep\nyou focused on the very best companies. Things begin to get exciting as the\nbroader market indexes start to bottom and begin the ﬁrst leg up in a new\nbull market. At this point, you should concentrate on the new 52-week-high list. Many of the market’s biggest winners will be on the list in the early stages of\na new bull market. You should also keep an eye on stocks that held up well\nduring the market’s decline and are within striking distance (5 to 15 per-\ncent) of a new 52-week high. Conversely, every day there is a list of stocks\nto avoid printed in the ﬁnancial newspapers: the 52-week-low list. I suggest\nthat you stay away from this list and all of its components. The 95 best-performing stocks of 1996 and 1997 took just ﬁve weeks to\nsurge 20 percent. On average, those stocks gained 421 percent. Among those\n95 stocks, 21 jumped 20 percent within a mere week. Those stocks went on\n\nT R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\nto surge on average 484 percent. In 1999, many of the best stocks took just\none week to run up 20 percent; some did it in only three days. All of them\ndisplayed superior relative strength before they advanced signiﬁcantly. If the market is indeed bottoming, a growing number of stocks will dis-\nplay improving relative price strength while they go through a compara-\ntively tight price correction. Generally, the correction for a healthy stock\nfrom peak to low will be contained within 25 to 35 percent and during\nsevere bear market declines could be as much as 50 percent, but the less, the\nbetter. A correction of more than 50 percent is generally too much, and a\nstock could fail as it reaches or slightly surpasses a new high. This is due to\nexcessive overhead supply created by the steep price decline. As the overall market is bottoming, your watch list should multiply\nover a number of weeks. The better stocks start moving into new high\nground as the market rallies off its lows. This is a good sign that the mar-\nket has bottomed or is getting close to a bottom. This is a critical juncture. Each emerging bull market tends to send up its unique set of leaders. The\nleaders of the past bull market rarely lead the next rally, so expect to see\nunfamiliar names. Fewer than 25 percent of market leaders in one cycle\ngenerally lead the next cycle. It’s important to recognize the new crop of\ntop-performing companies and industries as early as possible. Remember\nto listen to what the stocks are telling you, not the pundits. This will be your\nbest early-alert system. Tune Out the Media\n\nDuring a market decline the news is always ﬁlled with market gurus pre-\ndicting the end of the world. Pessimism abounds. Inevitably, another group\nof  so-called  experts  chime  in  that  the  bottom  may  be  near. But  they’ll\nannounce that a real rally cannot take place without getting the nod from\ntheir pet technical indicators. There is no shortage of elaborate theories\nand technical indicators that people use to time the market. This deluge of\nfear and conﬂicting advice can paralyze you on the cusp of a powerful rally.

Therefore, according to EMH, it is impossible to\noutperform the market by using data that the “market” already knows about\nexcept through luck. Defenders of this theory scoff at the notion that price\nand volume analysis can give an investor a winning edge. Needless to say, I\n\nT R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\ndisagree; my career and those of many other traders I know have demon-\nstrated that EMH is a ﬂawed theory. Most of those who subscribe to EMH\nhave never made a living from stock trading, let alone achieved superper-\nformance. Perhaps EMH makes sense to those who cannot outperform the\nmarket; since they cannot do it, they believe it’s impossible. Highly success-\nful traders know otherwise. Ultimately,  it’s  people—emotional,  imperfect,  even  illogical—who\nmake buy and sell decisions. Ego, fear, greed, hope, ignorance, incompe-\ntence, overreaction, and a host of other human errors in reasoning and judg-\nment create all sorts of discrepancies and in turn opportunity. An invaluable\ntool to use to discern those opportunities is charting the fundamental battle\nbetween supply and demand. Charts enable us to see what’s going on in a\nparticular stock as buyers and sellers come together in an auction market-\nplace. They distill the clash for emotional, logical, and even manipulative\ndecisions into a clear visual display; the verdict of supply and demand. If\nyou look at charts in this way, you will appreciate how these images depict\nall the choices people are making, whether to buy or to sell. In one glance\nyou can see precisely what took place in a particular time frame. There is nothing new under the sun in regard to charting and using\ngraphs. People have been using charts for centuries. Think of the ship cap-\ntains who charted the stars for navigation. In a similar way, we use charts to\nnavigate the market. Many investors try to read charts, but few know how\nto do it correctly. As I pointed out earlier, the argument some people make\nagainst charts is that past information cannot be predictive. If you were to\nutilize that philosophy in life, however, you would never be able to judge a\ncurrent event by using the evidence of the past: what a drop in barometric\npressure signals about the weather or that a 103-degree fever and body aches\nare symptoms of the ﬂu. Some people believe that you cannot time the market or time stock\ntrades  very  effectively,  that  attempting  to  do  so  is  a  fruitless  endeavor\nregardless of your techniques or available information. I can tell you from\nexperience that I owe much of my success to the precision of my timing,\nwhich would be virtually impossible without the use of charts.

My own trading relies on charting to the\nextent that I would never bet on my fundamental ideas alone without con-\nﬁrmation from the actual price action of the underlying stock. First, I uti-\nlize charts to establish the prevailing trend of a stock’s price. In other words,\ntechnical analysis enables me to qualify candidates for my watch list. Then I\nuse charts to time the entry of my trades. Can Charts Help You Achieve\nSuperperformance? Can charts empower you to predict the market? Of course not. You can’t\npredict the market any more than you can predict where the ball will drop\nduring the next spin of a roulette wheel. Fortunately, to succeed at stock\ntrading, you don’t have to predict the market any more than a casino needs\nto know in advance the outcome of each individual spin of its roulette\nwheel or each hand at its blackjack tables to make money from its gam-\ning operations. Those who think it’s necessary to predict stock prices to be\nsuccessful are missing the whole point. Savvy traders use price and volume\nanalysis as a mechanism to time their trades, manage risk, and increase the\nprobabilities for proﬁt. Many of the most successful traders know ﬁrsthand\nthe value of charting stocks. Their success has nothing to do with predic-\ntion or forecasting; rather, they rely on the acquired skill of reading the\nfootprints of the market and then expose their capital to high reward-to-\nrisk opportunities. Use Charts as a Tool\n\nBroadly speaking, there are three schools of thought about the art of chart-\ning  stocks,  also  referred  to  as  technical  analysis. The  ﬁrst  is  the  purest\nmethod, relying only on the price and volume action. Pure stock market\ntechnicians believe that everything you need to know is in the chart; they\nessentially regard fundamentals as unnecessary information that is ulti-\nmately “discounted,” that is, reﬂected in a stock’s share price. At the other\n\nT R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\nend of the spectrum is the second group: pure fundamentalists who believe\nthat everything you need to know lies in a company’s fundamentals. To\nthem, squiggly lines, candlesticks, and point-and-ﬁgure boxes are irrelevant. These number crunchers disdain chart analysis as something akin to read-\ning tea leaves. The third group consists of techno-fundamentalists. As the name sug-\ngests, these traders exploit both technical analysis and fundamental analysis. If I had to pick, I would put myself in this group. I rely on price and volume\nas well as fundamentals. In making the decision whether to purchase a stock,\nthere are important characteristics to consider, both fundamental and tech-\nnical. A healthy hybrid approach exploits charts as well as fundamentals to\nincrease the trader’s odds of success. The Effect, Not the Cause\n\nMany of the basic chart patterns were discovered in the pre-Depression era,\nin the early 1900s. You might well ask, Assuming that these trading pat-\nterns were effective in the remote past, might they have become so popular\nor readily available that they should have ceased to bestow an edge many\nyears ago? The answer is simple: Chart patterns are not the cause; they’re\nthe effect. The supply and demand picture does not dictate to the mar-\nket; human behavior does, and human behavior hasn’t changed and isn’t\nlikely to change much in the future. Thus, chart patterns remain powerful\ntools in timing trade entries and exits. Today, more information moves faster than ever and trades can be\nplaced in an instant with a click of a mouse. However, that has not changed\nbasic human nature. The charting techniques I explain in this chapter, like\neverything in this book, are based on what I do in my own trading: my daily\nwork, the product of 30 years of learning, application, reﬁnement, and per-\nsonal success in the stock market. Not only are these techniques applicable\ntoday, historical studies have shown that the techniques I used during my\nown career would have been effective many decades before my lifetime.

Over the years, people would walk into my ofﬁce, look at my computer\nmonitors, and ask, “How do you know what all those lines mean? They look\nso confusing.” The answer is that you have to know what you’re looking for. When I go into the doctor’s ofﬁce and get an EKG, I have no idea what the\nlines bouncing up and down on the little strip of paper printouts mean. But\nto a trained professional, this simple procedure of charting the activity and\nrhythm of a person’s heart can provide valuable information on whether the\nheart is acting normally or abnormally. Similarly, in examining a graph of a\nstock’s price and volume, we are looking to see if it is acting normally or giv-\ning us reason for concern. Therefore, charts provide valuable clues as well as\nspeciﬁc information. Price and volume analysis can help you determine whether a stock is\nunder accumulation or distribution (being bought or sold in size). It can\nalert an astute chart reader to extreme danger, and it can also indicate when\nthe odds of a potentially proﬁtable situation are relatively high. But only a\nsmall number of people who look at charts use them effectively, and only\na small percentage know what to focus on to produce really outstanding\nresults. The ultimate fundamental in any auction marketplace is the law\nof supply and demand. If you learn how to differentiate constructive from\nfaulty price action, you can use charts as a ﬁlter to screen your investment\ncandidates to ﬁnd the best possible selections and improve your odds of suc-\ncess.

If a stock doesn’t act as expected,\nthat’s a major red ﬂag. After all, the stock has already met very elite criteria\nand has been deemed a strong prospect. If such a stock behaves poorly, that\nsuggests a problem. Learning what to expect allows you to detect when a\nstock is acting correctly or incorrectly in the prevailing conditions. Because\nyou know how something is supposed to perform, when it doesn’t perform\nthat way, it makes the exit decision much easier. First Things First\n\nThe ﬁrst mistake I see amateurs make time and again when using charts is\nignoring the ﬁrst step: the big picture. The ﬁrst and most basic information\nthat charts show us is the prevailing trend of a stock. We can see if it’s trend-\ning up or down or is moving in a sideways pattern (i.e., stage 1, 2, 3, or 4). Once we have established that the longer-term trend is up (stage 2) and see\nsome evidence that a particular name is a candidate deserving of our atten-\ntion, whether it’s a market leader, a turnaround situation, or even a cyclical,\nit’s time to concern ourselves with the best time to purchase the stock. At\nthat point, we want to determine when the moment is right to pull the trig-\nger and make our commitment to the position. Therefore, charting can play\nan important role in selection and timing. My ﬁrst advice about charting stocks is that you should not look at\nthings in a vacuum. Most of the chart work I rely on is based on the contin-\nuation of an existing trend. This concept is fundamental to my approach. If you want to maximize compounding, you want to be where the action\nis and take advantage of momentum. You should limit your selections\nto those stocks displaying evidence of being supported by institutional\nbuying. You’re not trying to be the ﬁrst one on board; rather, you’re\n\nT R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\nlooking for where momentum is picking up and the risk of failure is rel-\natively low. To time my entry, I look for price consolidations, which are\nmomentary pauses or periods of rest within the context of a prior uptrend. However, too often an investor will buy a stock because it has a “great”\nchart base but will overlook the fact that the base is within the context of a\nlong-term downtrend. Going long a “great base” in a long-term downtrend is like saying you’re\nin good health by focusing on your low cholesterol reading when you have\npneumonia.

If you’re too late,\nyou run the risk of buying a late-stage base that is obvious to everyone and\nprone to failure. Time the trade correctly, though, and you could be on the\nway to a very sizable gain. I  never go against  the  long-term  trend. I look to go long a stage 2\nuptrend and go short a stage 4 downtrend, plain and simple. To be con-\nsistent and stack the probabilities in your favor, you need to operate in a\nsystematic fashion. The step-by-step approach I’m showing you here is a\nprocess. The ﬁrst part of that process is to qualify the current chart pattern\nby ﬁltering stocks on the basis of the prevailing trend and then buying them\nas they emerge from their consolidation periods before they become too\nwidely followed and obvious. However, the current chart pattern must be\nput into context. If the long-term trend is not up, the stock simply doesn’t\nqualify as a candidate for purchase. Therefore, don’t forget the big picture. As the saying goes, the trend is your friend. If you try to trade against it, the\ntrend becomes your worst enemy. To increase your odds of success, stick\nto stocks moving in a deﬁnite uptrend. If a stock’s price is in a long-term\ndowntrend, don’t even consider buying it. Look for Consolidation Periods\n\nOnce you have identiﬁed a stage 2 uptrend, the next step is to look for the\nconditions that facilitate a sustainable move higher: a proper base.

The proper time to begin buying is as the price emerges from a proper\n\nconsolidation. that I said a proper base, not just any base. Anyone can look at a chart and\nidentify a stock that is moving sideways. It takes more than that; you need\nto know precisely what to look for. A constructive price consolidation phase\nstarts as a period of rest or digestion during which the previous movement\nin the stock is met with temporary proﬁt taking, which leads to an equilib-\nrium or correction mode. The better stock selections generally will correct\nthe least amount percentagewise from absolute peak to trough during their\ncorrection phase. Stocks that are under accumulation will rest and consoli-\ndate within the context of a long-term uptrend and then continue higher. Most of these situations will show telltale signs. Depending on the particular\nfootprint of the price action over 3 to as many as 60 weeks of price history,\nthere are various nuances that will allow you to make an educated decision\nabout whether the stock should be bought or sold. T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\nThe Volatility Contraction Pattern\n\nMost investors cannot resist the urge to buy stocks at the wrong time, usu-\nally when the price is declining. I’m constantly asked whether I like this\nstock or that stock, and 99 percent of the time my reply is, “I wouldn’t buy\nit here.” The reason for this is that I have a strict discipline that only allows\nme to buy at a very speciﬁc point: the point at which reward outweighs risk. How do I identify this point? If there is any one commonality or Holy Grail that I follow and practice\nregularly, it is the concept of volatility contraction. This is a key distinction\nthat I look for in almost every trade. A common characteristic of virtu-\nally all constructive price structures (those under accumulation) is a con-\ntraction of volatility accompanied by speciﬁc areas in the base structure\nwhere volume contracts signiﬁcantly. I use the volatility contraction pattern\n(VCP) concept to illustrate this. For our purposes here, VCP is part of the supply and demand setup. The main role that VCP plays is establishing a precise entry point at the line\nof least resistance. In virtually all the chart patterns I rely on, I’m looking for\nvolatility to contract from left to right. I want to see the stock move from\ngreater volatility on the left side of the price base to lesser volatility on the\nright side. The Contraction Count\n\nIn February 1995, I purchased FSI International (FSII), which was emerging\nout of a cup-with-handle pattern. The stock displayed perfect VCP charac-\nteristics in a clear stage 2 uptrend. The consolidation period lasted 10 weeks,\ncorrected 18 percent in the cup, and contracted to just 5 percent in the han-\ndle area. Note the volume contraction during the tightest portion of the\nsetup on the far right side of the base. I bought the stock as it broke above\nthe high in the handle during week 11. The stock advanced 130 percent from\nthat point. During a VCP, you will generally see a succession of anywhere from two\nto six contractions, with the stock coming off initially by, say, 25 percent\nfrom its absolute high to its low. Then the stock rallies a bit, and then it sells\n\n\fC H A P T E R   1 0   A   P I C T U R E   I S   W O R T H   A   M I L L I O N   D O L L A R S\n\nFigure 10.3  FSI International (FSII) 1995\nIn February 1995, I purchased FSI International just as it was emerging from a\nclassic VCP pattern.

The progressive reduction in price volatility,\nwhich will be accompanied by a reduction in volume at particular points,\neventually signiﬁes that the base has been completed. As a rule of thumb, I like to see each successive contraction contained\nto about half (plus or minus a reasonable amount) of the previous pullback\nor contraction. The volatility, measured from high to low, will be greatest\nwhen sellers rush to take proﬁts. When sellers become scarcer, the price cor-\nrection will not be as dramatic, and volatility will decrease. Typically, most\nVCP setups will be formed by two to four contractions, although sometimes\nthere can be as many as ﬁve or six. This action will produce a pattern, which\nalso reveals the symmetry of the contractions being formed. I call these con-\ntractions Ts. Not all price patterns display VCP characteristics.

Or a stock could undergo successive consolidations, with\nvarying degrees of volatility to produce contractions, for example, from a 25\npercent correction, to a 10 percent, to a 5 percent, and so forth, which would\nbe indicative of a classic VCP progression.

The following chart shows four periods of volatility contraction within\nthe base that are framed by the dotted lines. The ﬁrst period started in April\n2006, when the stock declined from $19 a share to $13, correcting 31 percent\nfrom high to low. The stock then moved higher and consolidated again, fall-\ning from just under $17 to below $14 a share for a 17 percent pullback. This\nis the ﬁrst sign of contracting volatility.

At this point, I\nbegan getting interested in the stock. Finally, a short and narrow pullback of just 3 percent over two weeks\non very low volume formed the pivot buy point. This told me that selling\n\n\fC H A P T E R   1 0   A   P I C T U R E   I S   W O R T H   A   M I L L I O N   D O L L A R S\n\nactivity had dried up.

What Does Volatility Contraction Tell Us? If a stock is under accumulation, a price consolidation represents a period\nwhen  strong  investors  ultimately  absorb  weak  traders. Once  the “weak\nhands” have been eliminated, the lack of supply allows the stock to move\nhigher because even a small amount of demand will overwhelm the negli-\ngible inventory. This is referred to as the line of least resistance. Tightness\nin price from absolute highs to lows and tight closes with little change in\nprice from one day to the next and also from one week to the next are gen-\nerally constructive. These tight areas should be accompanied by a signiﬁ-\ncant decrease in trading volume. In some instances, volume dries up at or\nnear the lowest levels established since the beginning of the stock’s advance. This is a very positive development, especially if it takes place after a period\nof correction and consolidation, and is a telltale sign that the amount of\nstock coming to market has diminished. A stock that is under accumulation\nwill almost always show these characteristics (tightness in price with volume\ncontracting). This is what you want to see before you initiate your purchase\non the right side of the base, which forms what we call the pivot buy point. Speciﬁcally, the point at which you want to buy is when the stock moves\nabove the pivot point on expanding volume.

I can assure\nyou that almost every failed base structure that you experience can be\ntraced back to some faulty characteristic that was overlooked. Many books\nsuperﬁcially describe technical patterns. Pattern recognition exercises will\noften lead you astray if you lack an understanding of the supply and demand\nforces that give rise to high-probability setups as opposed to head fakes. Let’s\nlook a little more deeply at the nature and forces of supply and demand to\nunderstand what is actually taking place. Detecting Overhead Supply\n\nAs a stock corrects and heads lower, inevitably there are trapped buyers who\nbought around the stock’s previous high point and are now sitting with a\nloss; trapped buyers agonize over their deepening paper losses and, sweat-\ning bullets, look for a rally to sell. As their losses grow and more time passes,\n\n\fC H A P T E R   1 0   A   P I C T U R E   I S   W O R T H   A   M I L L I O N   D O L L A R S\n\nmany of these buyers would be delighted just to get even. This is what cre-\nates overhead supply: investors who want out around their breakeven point;\nthey can’t wait to sell and assuage their egos by thinking that despite the\nroller-coaster ordeal, they “got out even.”\n\nAdding to the supply issue is another group of buyers who, unlike the\ntrapped buyers sitting at a loss and waiting to break even, were fortunate\nenough to bottom ﬁsh the stock and now are accumulating very nice prof-\nits. As the stock trades back up near its old high, as the trapped buyers are\ngetting even, the proﬁt takers also feel the urge to sell and nail down a quick\nbuck. All this selling creates a price pullback on the right side of the base. If the stock is indeed being accumulated by institutions, the contractions\nwill be smaller from left to right as supply is absorbed by the bigger players. When a stock traces out a VCP and undergoes a series of contractions, it is\nsimply the law of supply and demand at work, an indication that the stock is\nchanging hands in an orderly manner. You should wait until the stock goes\n\nFigure 10.8  Theoretical example of supply/demand dynamics\nA signiﬁcant contraction in volume associated with tightness in price signals\nsupply has stopped coming to market and the line of least resistance has been\nestablished.", "char_count": 2920, "word_count": 537, "created_at": "2025-11-01T06:08:54.606311Z"}

As a trader using a stop loss, you are a weak holder. The key\nis to be the last weak holder; you want the other weak holders to exit the\nstock before you buy. Evidence that supply has stopped coming to market is revealed as the\ntrading volume contracts signiﬁcantly and price action quiets down notice-\nably. Demanding this attribute will help you avoid a crowded trade, improv-\ning the likelihood that the stock is off the public’s radar, which increases\nthe odds of success. If the stock’s price and volume don’t quiet down on\nthe right side of the consolidation, chances are that supply is still coming to\nmarket and the stock is too risky. Why Buy Near a New High? One of the most common phrases you hear in the stock market is “buy low\nand sell high.” These words have become synonymous with the way most\npeople think about how to make money in stocks. Of course, it’s obvious\nthat you have to buy at a price lower than the price at which you sell to make\na proﬁt. However, this does not mean that you have to buy at or near the\nlowest price at which a stock has traded historically. Markets are far more\noften correct than are personal opinions or even expert forecasts. A stock\nmaking a new 52-week high during the early stages of a fresh bull mar-\nket could be a stellar performer in its infancy. In contrast, a stock near its\n52-week low at best has overhead supply to work through and lacks upside\nmomentum; worse still, such a stock may be headed for a series of lower\nlows. A stock hitting a new high has no overhead supply to contend with. The stock is saying, “Hey, I have something going on here, and people are\ntaking notice,” whereas a stock hitting a new low is clearly a laggard that\nlacks investor interest or is being dumped in size by institutions. There are those of you who say, “I don’t want to wait until the stage\n2 criteria are conﬁrmed.” You want to try to get in early, when the stock is\nmoving off its lows. The problem here is that there is no conﬁrmation in the\nearly stages. How do you know that the stock is attracting institutions? Even\n\n\fC H A P T E R   1 0   A   P I C T U R E   I S   W O R T H   A   M I L L I O N   D O L L A R S\n\na good start can get derailed if the fundamentals aren’t really there, and you\nend up buying a bounce that ﬁzzles and the stock stays in stage 1 limbo or,\nworse, breaks down and declines. When a stock reaches a new high in a conﬁrmed stage 2 uptrend sup-\nported by big volume clues, it has been propelled upward by institutions\ntaking positions because they believe that the fundamentals are solid and the\nprospects for the future are even better. In the following examples you can\nsee how the real excitement doesn’t even start until these stocks are hitting\nall-time price highs.

Chart courtesy of Longboard Asset Management. The only way a stock can become a superperformer, moving from, say,\n$20 to $80, is for that stock to make a series of new highs repeatedly, all the\nway up. The same thing applies to a stock that’s at $50 and doubles to $100\non its way to $300. Monster Beverage (MNST) registered an all-time high in\nlate 2003. If you were afraid to buy the stock because it appeared too high,\nyou would have missed a huge opportunity; the stock price advanced 8,000\npercent by early 2006.

You\nshouldn’t conclude that a stock is a bargain just because it’s trading down 50\nor 60 percent off its high. First, such a decline could indicate that a serious\nfundamental problem is undermining the share price. Second, even if the\nfundamentals are not problematic yet, a stock that has experienced a deep\nsell-off must contend with a large amount of overhead supply: the more a\nstock drops, the more it is burdened by trapped buyers. Finally, the more a\nstock declines, the more potential proﬁt takers will be waiting to sell if the\nstock rallies and intersects overhead supply; the larger the proﬁt is, the more\nlikely it is that bottom feeders will sell. During major bear market correc-\n\nFigure 10.13  Mankind (MNKD) 2009–2012\nMankind (MNKD) rallied back near its old highs into overhead supply where\nselling took the stock down precipitously.

I rarely buy a stock that has corrected 60 percent or more; a stock that is\ndown that much often signals a serious problem. Most constructive set-\nups correct between 10 percent and 35 percent. You will have more success\nif you concentrate on stocks that correct the least versus the ones that cor-\nrect the most. Under most conditions, stocks that correct more than two or\nthree times the decline of the general market should be avoided. Time Compression\n\nIf a stock advances too quickly up the right side, this forms a hazardous\ntime compression, and in most cases the stock should be avoided, at least\ntemporarily. Time compression will show up as V-shaped price action or\nthe absence of proper right-side development. Constructive price consoli-\n\nT R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\ndations tend to have a degree of symmetry; a buildup of supply takes time\nto digest and work through. A quick up-and-down gyration doesn’t give\nthe stock enough time to weed out the weak holders; it takes time for the\nstrong hands to relieve the weaker players. You want to give your stock\nenough time to undergo a constructive consolidation period, which will\nallow it to continue its primary advance unencumbered by the chains of\nimmediate sellers. Depending on the depth of the correction, a proper basing period can\nlast anywhere from 3 weeks to as long as 65 weeks. By demanding that the\nprice action display VCP characteristics, you will increase your chances of\nidentifying a stock in which supply is diminishing and a sound point for\nentry is developing, which will lead to an immediate and sustained advance.

It’s beyond the purview of this book, but\nthere are professional traders who are expert at picking off the amateurs\nwhen obvious support areas are breached and trigger the amateurs’ stand-\ning orders. Don’t get confused; what you may think is just a shakeout is not the\ntime to buy a declining stock. We are not forecasters; we are interpreters. When a stock that is seemingly in the process of building a base undercuts\na support ﬂoor, it may be a price shakeout, or the stock could be entering\na precipitous or sustained decline. This is why you wait to see if it results\nin a shakeout. Ideally, you want to see this occur one, two, or three times,\n\nFigure 10.18  Meridian Bioscience (VIVO) 2007\nMeridian Bioscience had several key points where the stock price undercut\nprevious lows creating constructive shakeouts.

Shakeouts can occur at the lows of a base, on the right side, and in the\nhandle or pivot area. Look for Evidence of  Demand\n\nSo far we have taken an aerial view to identify candidates that meet our crite-\nria on the basis of the footprint formed by their price action. At this point in\nour analysis, we have already determined that a stock is in a stage 2 uptrend. As that previous uptrend is digested, people will sell and take proﬁts; there-\nfore, we will look for some correction to occur. When that selling occurs,\nthere will be some people who wish they had taken a proﬁt but did not. When the stock moves up again, they will seize the next opportunity to get\nout. What we want to see is what comes next. After the selling has slowed, is\n\n\fC H A P T E R   1 0   A   P I C T U R E   I S   W O R T H   A   M I L L I O N   D O L L A R S\n\nthere still an appetite for the stock? Will big demand come in after a sell-off\nto propel the stock even higher? Or is the move over? By closely observing\nprice and volume action, we can gain this insight. At this point, we want to zoom in and look for signs of institutional\naccumulation. A sign of accumulation is a spike up in price. Price spikes\ngenerally occur off the lows of a correction within the base and on the right\nside of the base; this kind of price action gains credence if it is accompanied\nby outsized volume. A spike in price on overwhelming volume often indi-\ncates institutional buying, which is exactly what we’re looking for. After\na price shakeout, it’s a good sign if the stock rallies back on big volume. A stock may experience big price spikes in the form of gaps. A price gap\noccurs when the share price prints at a wide increment above or below the\nprevious print; this is most easily observable at the open, but in thinly traded\nstocks it can also occur intraday. Gaps often occur on big volume. Upward\nprice gaps may result from positive news such as better than expected earn-\nings, a favorable industry development, or a brokerage house upgrade. Ideally, the gap will result from a fundamental change that creates a positive\nshift in perception and generates buying demand. In many cases, a price gap\nwill show up on a weekly graph as well. What you’re trying to determine is\nwhether the stock is under accumulation by large institutional buyers. The next chart shows Meridian Bioscience (VIVO) as the stock price\ninitially came down and put in a low in May, a level that was undercut in\nJuly; after that, the stock came roaring back, followed by a short-term pull-\nback and then a big gap to the upside. Accompanying that gap was a surge\nof volume, reﬂecting strong demand. A sideways pattern developed dur-\ning October, with a sell-off that took out the September low, triggering\nanother price shakeout. Notice how the overall price structure is beginning\nto tighten up. The combination of the big demand (gap) days, low-volume\npullbacks, several price shakeouts within the base, and a contraction in price\nprovided sufﬁcient evidence that this stock was under accumulation. Even\nas the stock tightened up and formed the handle area in December, it under-\nwent two minor price shakeouts, adding even more strength to the setup. Keep in mind that one aspect alone did not make for a great trade setup. Rather, it was a combination of all these factors.

A big price spike on a surge of volume indicates that institutions are\nbuying in size. At the same time, you’ll want to see a dearth of down spikes. In other words, the volume must be much bigger on up days than on down\ndays, and a few of the price spikes to the upside should be large, dwarﬁng the\ncontractions that have occurred on relatively lower volume.

This may come on news and cause the stock\nto become extended and prone to a pullback, particularly if the overall\nmarket begins correcting. Cirrus Logic raised its earnings guidance by\nforecasting better than expected numbers for the upcoming quarter. This\ncaused the stock to shoot up dramatically. Within days of the price spike,\nthe overall market started correcting. This put temporary pressure on\nCirrus’s stock price, causing it to correct 23 percent off its high, which\nwas an acceptable 2.3 times the market correction. Once the market bot-\ntomed, the stock price moved up the right side and set up constructively. Cirrus advanced +162 percent in just four months from the point at which\nit made a new 52-week high. Figure 10.26  Cirrus Logic (CRUS) 2010\nCirrus Logic rallied on earnings guidance, leaving the stock price extended and\nvulnerable to a pullback. After pulling in during an intermediate general market\ncorrection, the stock emerged as a market leader.

The Pivot Point\n\nA proper pivot point represents the completion of a stock’s consolidation\nand the cusp of its next advance. In other words, after a base pattern has\nbeen established, the pivot point is where the stock establishes a price level\nthat will act as the trigger to enter that trade. Now the stock has moved into\nposition for purchase. As the stock’s price trades above the high of the pivot,\nthis often represents the start of the next advancing phase. A pivot point is\na “call to action” price level. It is often referred to as the optimal buy point. A pivot point can occur in connection with a stock breaking into new high\nterritory or below the stock’s high. In the context of a stock’s consolidation, a temporary pause allows you\nto set a price trigger to enter a trade. For example, a trader might put in a\n\nlimit order to buy 1,000 shares if the price breaks the upper level of the pivot\n\nT R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\npoint. You want to buy as close to the pivot point as possible without chas-\ning the stock up more than a few percentage points. Jesse Livermore described the pivot point as the line of least resistance. A stock can move very fast once it crosses this threshold. When a stock\nbreaks through the line of least resistance, the chances are the greatest\nthat it will move higher in a short period of time. This is the case because\nthis point represents an area where supply is low; therefore, even a small\namount of demand can move the stock higher. Rarely does a correct pivot\npoint fail coming out of a sound consolidation. The  next  chart  shows  Mercadolibre  (MELI),  which  has  a  technical\nfootprint of 6W 32/6 3T, meaning that the basing period occurred over six\nweeks, with corrections that began at 32 percent and concluded at 6 percent\nat the pivot. In November, the stock underwent a price shakeout and pro-\nceeded to tighten up in a constructive fashion.

In fact, we want to see volume on the ﬁnal\ncontraction that is below the 50-day average, with one or two days when vol-\nume is extremely low.

With\nvery little supply of stock in the market from sellers, even a small amount of\nbuying can move the price up very rapidly.

Let’s say that a stock normally trades 1 million shares. Two hours\ninto the trading day, 500,000 shares—half the usual volume—has already\nexchanged hands and the stock is moving up. You still have four and a half\nhours to go. Therefore, you can comfortably extrapolate that on the basis of\nthe intraday volume thus far, the volume for the day could easily be 300 to\n400 percent (or more) of the average daily volume. Now, when the price goes\nthrough the pivot point, you can place your trade. Always Wait for the Stock to Pivot\nSome investors will try to get in before the breach of the pivot point to save\na few pennies on the trade. Assuming that a stock will break out is danger-\nous. If the pivot point is tight, there is no material advantage in getting\nin early; you will accomplish little except to take on unnecessary risk. Let\nthe stock break above the pivot and prove itself. The pivot point is only\none part of the overall setup, but it’s the most important piece of the puzzle\nbefore I buy a stock, because it is the ﬁnal determinant of when I’m going to\npull the trigger and risk my capital. Not all consolidations have tight pivot points. When a ﬂat base occurs\nwith no real pivot other than the high of the base, an investor can look to buy\nas the stock moves above the highest price at the top of the base provided\nthat the base corrects no more than 10 or 15 percent. Other price patterns,\nsuch as a cup completion cheat (3-C), or a cup with handle, can form pivot\npoints below the high of the overall structure. This step-by-step approach will help you time your trades with accu-\nracy as you determine the optimal place for a low-risk and potentially\nhigh-reward trade. If you use the techniques I just described, you will have\nmore precision and a better rationale for placing your trades. This does\nnot mean that you will never have a loss or that the stock will not pull\nback, hit your stop, and leave you on the sidelines. If your analysis is faulty,\nor you’re attempting to trade on the long side during a bear market, the\n\nT R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\nsearch for a pivot may result in frustration instead of a signiﬁcant entry\npoint or possibly an abrupt failure soon after your purchase. The success\nof the pivot point is related to how well the setup has been established. Squats and Reversal Recoveries\n\nSometimes a stock will break out from a pivot point only to fall back into\nits range and close off the day’s high. This is what I refer to as a squat. When\nthis happens, I don’t always jump ship right away; I try to wait at least a day\nor two to see if the stock can stage a reversal recovery. This accommodation\nmakes sense especially in a bull market. In some cases it can take up to ten\ndays or longer for a recovery to occur. This is not a hard-and-fast rule; some\nmay take a little longer, and some fail and stop you out. Of course, if the reversal is large enough to trigger my stop, I sell. If the\nreversal causes the price to close below its 20-day moving average, it lowers\nthe probability of success and it becomes a judgment call; sometimes I sell if\nthis happens. However, as long as the price holds above my stop loss, I try to\ngive the stock some room. If the price action tightens and volume subsides, the setup could be\nimproving, and it could be that you’ve just entered the trade a bit early.

Once a stock breaks out of its pivot area, watch for signs of failure; a failed\nbreakout can quickly lead to a base failure. Once the stock successfully\nbreaks out, the stock price should hold its 20-day moving average and in\nmost cases should not close below it. The pattern should not get wider\n(meaning up and down movements). Up is good, but wild swings back and\nforth are not. Although the price may pull back or even squat, don’t auto-\nmatically conclude that the trade is going to fail. You want to give the stock a\nchance to recover. If it pulls in, holds above the 20-day average, and squats,\noften the stock will recover the next day or within a few days. However, if it\nhits your stop, get out and reevaluate.

This occurs when a stock moves up in the morning and then\ncomes back down to the breakout before noon or 1:00 p.m. Try to give the\nstock until the end of the day unless the reversal is so severe that it triggers\nyour protective stop. You should not panic and conclude that the break-\nout has failed just because the early morning rally lost steam and the stock\npulled in. This often happens. The stock may even undercut your pur-\nchase price. Stick to your game plan and hold to your original stop loss. In\na healthy market, often stocks that do this will recover later in the day and\nclose strong.

If I really like a stock, I circle it. If a stock shows potential, I underline\nit. If a stock has formed a pivot point, I put in an asterisk after the symbol. If\nthe pivot point is immediately buyable, I circle the asterisk. If a stock is set-\nting up in such a way that I would be interested on a pullback, I write “pb”\nnext to it. You will also notice that on the right I use the technical footprint\nabbreviation for the names I’m most interested in. Here’s how this translates into my trading system. Stocks that have\nbeen circled or have asterisks will go on my quote screen for close atten-\ntion. Those that are underlined do not have setups that are mature enough\nat this point, but they bear watching. The rest will stay on the watch list to\nsee what develops. I rank them as watch, buy alert, and buy ready. As time\nprogresses, some stocks may become actionable. Some on the watch list will\nmove up (from watch to buy alert and then to buy ready), and some will fall\noff entirely. Once I have my list of stocks, I can watch how they trade intra-\nday.

Saucer with Platform\n\nIn the 1960s, William L. Jiler wrote a book titled How Charts Can Help You\nin the Stock Market. In my opinion, Jiler’s work on chart patterns was way\nahead of its time and to this day still has valuable ﬁndings. I would put\nit on the must-read list for anyone interested in using charts to improve\nhis or her performance in the stock market. Jiler was the ﬁrst to highlight\nthe saucer-with-platform pattern, which later became popularized as the\ncup-with-handle pattern. This pattern without a doubt is the most repeat-\nable and reliable price structure among all the variations that superper-\nformance stocks trace out before they advance dramatically in price. Jiler\nrefers to the saucer pattern as a “dream pattern,” citing its ease of recogni-\ntion and reliability. Although I agree with Jiler, the pattern is prone to mis-\ninterpretation. The VCP concept and some education about volume and\ncertain speciﬁc nuances to look for can quickly clear up poor analysis and\nlead you to ﬁnd the next big superperformer. As was mentioned above,\n\n\fC H A P T E R   1 0   A   P I C T U R E   I S   W O R T H   A   M I L L I O N   D O L L A R S\n\nFigure 10.49  Elan PLC (ELN) 1991\n\nElan forms a cup with handle pattern. Chart courtesy of Interactive Data. volatility contraction is a key characteristic of constructive price behavior\nwithin all patterns. The 3C Pattern\n\nThe cup completion cheat, or 3C, is a continuation pattern; it is the earliest\npoint at which you should attempt to buy a stock. Some stocks form a low\ncheat, and some form the cheat area, near the middle of the cup or saucer\nthat precedes it. The key is to recognize when the stock has bottomed and\nidentify when the start of a new uptrend is under way, back in sync with the\nprimary stage 2. The cheat trade gives you an actionable pivot point to time\na stock’s upturn while increasing your odds of success. When a handle forms, it usually occurs in the upper third of the cup. If\nit forms in the middle third of the cup or just below the halfway point, you\ncould get more than one buy point. Figure 10.50  Cirrus Logic (CRUS) 2010\nIn February 2010, Cirrus Logic formed a 3C pivot point (cheat area) and then a\nhandle in March. Figure 10.51  Valassis Communications (VCI) 2010\nIn January 2010, a handle formed just above the cheat area; both provided\nviable pivot points for entry. C H A P T E R   1 0   A   P I C T U R E   I S   W O R T H   A   M I L L I O N   D O L L A R S\n\nThe cheat area is the earliest point at which I attempt to trade a cup\npattern. You don’t want to be involved any earlier than this point. Like the\nhandle, a valid cheat area should exhibit a contraction in volume as well as\ntightness in the range of price. This pause presents an opportunity to enter\nthe trade at the earliest point, perhaps not always with your entire position,\nbut you can lower your average cost basis by exploiting cheat areas to scale\ninto trades. Once the stock trades above the high in the pause area, it has\nmade the turn; it probably has made its low and will resume the longer-term\nstage 2 primary trend. The cheat setup has the same qualiﬁcations as the classic cup with han-\ndle because it’s simply the cup portion being completed. To qualify, the\nstock should have already moved up by at least 25 to 100 percent—and\nin some cases by 200 or 300 percent—during the previous 3 to 36 months\nof trading. The stock should also be trading above its upwardly trending\n200-day moving average (provided that 200 days of trading in the stock has\noccurred). The pattern can form in as few as 3 weeks to as many as 45 weeks\n\nFigure 10.52  Google (GOOG) 2004\nIn September 2004, Google formed a rare low cheat pivot point. It rose 600\npercent in 38 weeks. T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\n(most are 7 to 25 weeks in duration). The correction from peak to low point\nvaries from 15 or 20 percent to 35 or 40 percent in some cases and as much\nas 50 percent, depending on the general market conditions. Corrections in\nexcess of 60 percent are too deep and are extremely prone to failure. It is\ncommon for a cheat setup to develop during a general market correction. The most powerful stocks will rally off this pattern just as the general market\naverages turn up from a correction or at least close to the same time. Making the Turn\n\nA. Downtrend. The stock will experience an intermediate-term\n\nprice correction that takes place within the context of a longer-\nterm stage 2 uptrend. This leg down can happen over a number of\nweeks or months, and it is normal to experience large price spikes\nalong the downtrend on increased volume. B. Uptrend. The price will attempt to rally and break its downtrend. You do not want to buy just yet; it’s too early. At this point, the\nprice and volume action lacks the necessary conﬁrmation that\nthe stock has bottomed and entered a new uptrend. The price\nwill start to run up the right side, usually recouping about one-\nthird to one-half its previous decline; however, overhead supply\ncreated during the intermediate downtrend will typically be strong\nenough to stall the price advance and create a pause or pullback.

The fact that it had a shakeout\ncould turn out to be constructive for the stock going forward.

Proof comes in the form of a primary base: the ﬁrst buyable base\nafter a company has gone public. The base forms during a corrective period\nof three weeks or longer that is followed by the emergence to an all-time high\nor from a constructive consolidation near the stock’s all-time high. During the recovery phase in which it recoups lost ground, the stock\nbreaks into new high territory. Over the course of a long advance, a lead-\ning stock will form many such bases or consolidations. It will weather the\nensuing proﬁt taking and sell-offs and then proceed to new price highs. The\nprimary base is simply the ﬁrst occurrence of this bullish chart pattern in a\nstock’s trading history. Stocks that began phenomenal advances from pri-\nmary bases include Yahoo!, eBay, Google, Starbucks, Reebok, Microsoft,\nand Intel, as well as Amazon.com and Research in Motion, to name a few. The primary base points to the possible future direction of a stock from\nits price and volume history, but the primary base has deep roots in so-called\ncorporate fundamentals as well as the stock’s market action. The biggest\npart of a company’s growth usually occurs in the ﬁrst 5 to 10 years after the\ncompany issues common stock and goes public. That’s when the company’s\nproducts or services are expanding into new, untapped markets fueled by\nthe cash raised in the public offering. This crucial period is when manage-\nment tends to be at its entrepreneurial best. As sales expand and economies\nof scale improve, margins are boosted and proﬁt growth accelerates. Remember, the fact that a company has recently gone public doesn’t\nnecessarily mean that it has been in business only for a short period. Some\ncompanies operate successfully as private organizations for many decades\nbefore they go public, whereas others are brand new start-ups in new indus-\ntries.

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\nI can remember reading about the winners in the Wall Street Journal in\nthe 1980s. A young trader by the name of David Ryan won the contest three\nyears in a row between 1984 and 1986, a magniﬁcent achievement. Another\nwell-known champ was S&P futures trader Martin “Buzzy” Schwartz. Both\nRyan and Schwartz would later be proﬁled by Jack Schwager in his ﬁrst\nMarket Wizards book. To me, it was clear that to win the USIC and join the\nranks of these champions was to join an elite circle. In 1996, at age 31, I decided to enter the contest. I felt conﬁdent that\nmy skills had reached the point where I could win. Whoever made the\nmost money during a one-year period was the champion; pretty simple. The account size required for entry was $25,000. I posted the $25,000 and\ntraded in my usual style: aggressively with supertight risk control. Each day,\nI combed my watch list to determine the best possible moment for execut-\ning a trade. Although I was conﬁdent of victory, I kept my focus on sticking\nto my trading plan. My goal, as always, was to make as much money as pos-\nsible, but only by executing the best trades at the optimal time, never by tak-\ning impulsive actions that deviated from my trading regime. At the end of the ﬁrst quarter, I was up 49.72 percent and had run the\n$25,000 account up to $37,430. Quarterly results were not being published\npublicly at the time, and so I had no idea how well my performance stacked\nup against those of the other traders. By the end of the second quarter, I\nreally hit my stride. My account was up an additional 93.75 percent, bring-\ning my total return for the ﬁrst six months to +190.08 percent. My contest\ntrading account was at $72,521, and I had the feeling I was pretty well posi-\ntioned in the ﬁeld of competitors. Shortly after that day I got an unexpected phone call from one of the\ncontest coordinators. He told me that the championship was being sus-\npended because of an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission\nabout an advertisement issue relating to previously published performance\nresults. I couldn’t believe it. I had ﬁnally decided to enter the USIC, and the\nSEC was closing it down! “Can you at least tell me where I stand, what place\nI’m in?” I asked. If nothing else, I would have the satisfaction of knowing\nhow I ranked among the other competitors. “Mark, you’re way in the lead by more than 100 percent,” he told me.

But as with a bad trade, when disappointment comes, you deal with it and\nmove on. Later that year, I received another call from the contest organizer, who\nexplained that the issues with the SEC had been resolved and the contest\nwas back on. The competition would resume on January 1, 1997. However,\nthe results of 1996 would not carry over. It was a new contest. If I wanted to\nenter, I had to start all over again.

Although\nthis seemed incredibly unfair—a pure stock guy like me going up against\noptions and futures traders who could use massive leverage—I decided to\nenter the ﬁrst division, putting up $250,000 of my own money. In the ﬁrst quarter, I was up just a little over 8 percent; that was not\nnearly enough to qualify for the top spot, but it was the ﬁnal tally I was\nconcerned with.

I’m not suggesting that you not allow a stock to go through a normal\nreaction or pullback in price if you believe the stock can go much higher. Of course, you should give stocks some room to ﬂuctuate, but that leeway\nhas little to do with your past gain.

Sound Principles Provide Clarity\n\nMy biggest losses have always come after I have had a great period\n\nand I started to think that I knew something. —Paul Tudor Jones\n\nThere are certainly times when money can be made very easily in the stock\nmarket. Often this leads to carelessness, which in turn can lead to disaster. At the end of the day, success is not decided by your winnings from any\nparticular day, month, or quarter; it’s what you keep year in and year out. Adherence to sound risk-management principles will not only allow you\nkeep the proﬁts you’ve acquired but will also keep your feet on the ground\nwhen your head is in the sky because you’ve become overly ambitious after\na period of success. You’ve undoubtedly heard the phrase “cut your losses and let your\nwinners  ride.” When  I  was  interviewed  by  Jack  Schwager  for  his  book\nStock  Market  Wizards:  Interviews  with  America’s  Top  Stock  Traders\n(HarperBusiness 2001, 2003), I spent a lot of time talking about loss cutting\n\n\fC H A P T E R   1 2   R I S K   M A N A G E M E N T   P A R T   1\n\nas the key to my success. At one point during the interview, Jack stopped the\ntape recorder and said, “Mark, this stuff is great, but it’s a cliché; it’s what all\nthe successful traders say.”\n\n“Jack, of course that’s what they say,” I told him. “That’s why they’re\n\nsuccessful, and that’s why I’m successful.”\n\nWhen you have been trading for a long time, you can easily lose per-\nspective as you cultivate new techniques. If you’re not careful, the basic\nfundamentals may come in your mind or, more subtly, in your subcon-\nscious to seem remedial. Far from being training wheels to be cast off with\nmaturity, the basics of risk management must be continually refreshed in\nyour mind and perfected. Maybe that sounds unexciting, but as the leg-\nendary quarterback Roger Staubach said, “It takes a lot of unspectacular\npractice to get spectacular results.”\n\nA Lesson from Master Jack\n\nPart of my obsession with perfecting the basics goes back to my days as a kid\nin karate school. I was somewhat gifted as far as being able to do gymnastic-\ntype maneuvers, and after only a short time I could do all sorts of complex\nkarate moves and even a backward no-hand ﬂip. They gave me the nick-\nname Movie Man because of my ability to do the types of moves you saw\nin kung fu ﬁlms. Even so, I was still a novice, and my teacher, Master Jack\nMoscato, knew I needed humbling. One day, Master Jack told me to assume the basic front stance, which\nis one of the very ﬁrst things you learn. He walked around me quietly and\nthen suddenly kicked out my front leg. I fell crashing to the ground. When I\nlooked up in surprise, Master Jack stared down at me and said, “Maybe you\nshould learn to stand before you learn to ﬂip.” That lesson has stayed with\nme ever since. Master the basics. My karate instructor was a stickler for per-\nfecting the basics. Every day, remind yourself that the key building blocks\nfor success include executing the basics better than the other guy and doing\nit over and over again. Greatness is built on a solid foundation of fundamen-\ntal principles. T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\nLosses Make You Work Harder\n\nWhen you lose money on a stock trade, you will need a greater percentage\ngain to get back to even because losses work against you geometrically. For\nexample, if a stock declines 50 percent in price, let’s say from $28 to $14, that\nstock will have to rise by 100 percent (from $14 to $28) to get back to even. That’s worth repeating: a 50 percent decline in price requires a double to\nbreak even. What happens if you keep your losses relatively small? A 10 percent loss\nrequires an 11 percent gain to return to even, and a 5 percent loss needs only\na 5.26 percent gain. This is why you never want to let your losses get too\nlarge. Also, if you lose a big portion of your account, you lose your buying\npower. Your account will be much smaller when you ﬁnally latch on to a big\nwinner. The last thing you want to do is put yourself in a position of losing\nwhen your account is large and a position of gaining when it’s small; this\nwill accomplish little. By keeping your losses small, you preserve your hard-\nearned capital for future investments. The lesson here is never to permit yourself to lose an amount of\nmoney that would jeopardize your account. The larger the loss is, the\nmore difﬁcult it is to recover from it. Set an absolute maximum line in the\nsand of no more than 10 percent on the downside. Your average loss should\nbe much less, maybe 6 or 7 percent. If you can’t be correct on your purchase\nwith a 10 percent cushion for normal price ﬂuctuation, you have a different\n\nFigure 12.1  Gain needed to break even from loss\n\n\fC H A P T E R   1 2   R I S K   M A N A G E M E N T   P A R T   1\n\nproblem to address. Either your selection criteria and timing are ﬂawed or\nthe overall market is hostile and you should be out of stocks. Two Up and One Down\n\nIf I guaranteed you a three year compounded return consisting of two 50\npercent up years and one 50 percent down year, that may sound like a pretty\ngood deal, but think again. Regardless of the order, you would have a three-\nyear total return of 12.5 percent, or about 4 percent per year. That’s not\nexactly the type of return you hope for when investing in stocks, especially\ntaking into consideration all the risks you have to take. Actually, there’s no\ngood “two up, one down” deal. About the best you can hope for is two 30\npercent gains and one 30 percent loss, which results in a return of about\n5.75 percent per year; still not very impressive. This demonstrates how losses\nwork geometrically against you. To achieve big results, your gains must\neclipse your losses on a risk/reward basis—period! Figure 12.2  Various returns based on three-year compounding\n\nConvincing Myself:\nThe Loss Adjustment Exercise\n\nThe deﬁnition of a great investor is someone who starts by\n\nunderstanding the downside. —Sam Zell\n\nT R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\nEarly in my career, I did not understood the dramatic effect of losses and the\nimportance of cutting them short. Like most traders, I had periods of suc-\ncess followed by some fairly drastic drawdowns because of a few trades gone\nwrong. I thought loss cutting sounded logical and tried to apply it to my\ntrading, but every now and then I would break the rule, hoping that things\nwould turn around, sometimes holding on to my favorite position for dear\nlife. It got to the point where I was confused, and so I decided to test the\neffects of cutting my losses on all my trades. I decided to adjust all of my past losses to an arbitrary level of 10 per-\ncent to see what the effect of capping the downside would be. This included\nadjusting the losses that were smaller up to 10 percent as well as adjusting\nthe ones that were larger down. As I said, occasionally I would hold on to\na stock that had fallen, and from time to time I would take 20 percent and\neven 30 percent losses. When I adjusted those losses and capped them at\n10 percent, the effect on my performance was amazing. Capping the losses\nwould have knocked me out of a few of my winners; however, this con-\nsequence was overwhelmed by the loss-cutting effect. The hypothetical\nimprovement in the overall portfolio performance seemed too dramatic to\nbe believed. I rechecked the math two or three times, and the numbers were\ncorrect. Instead of having a double-digit percentage loss in my portfolio, I\nwould have had a gain of more than 70 percent.

As a disciplined investor, you have good reason to be\noptimistic about your chances for success. But the stock market can strike\nwithout notice, transforming your lofty dreams into a ﬁnancial nightmare,\na lesson learned by the tens of millions of investors who suffered huge losses\nduring the bear market that began in March 2000 and those who attempted\nto ride out the storm in the bear market of 2007–2008. Whether you’re\ninvesting in blue chip stocks or trading pork bellies, any seasoned pro will\ntell you that there is no room for ego. The market can and will break anyone\nwho ignores the risks and dangers. With each bear market a new group of\ninvestors learn this lesson the hard way. The ﬁrst discipline you need to learn to be a successful stock trader\nis simple to comprehend mentally, but for the majority of traders it’s the\nmost difﬁcult to perform regularly: the best way to stay clear of the mar-\nket’s wrath is to accept its judgment. Knowing When You’re Wrong\n\nGood trading is a peculiar balance between the conviction to follow\n\nyour ideas and the ﬂexibility to recognize when you have made a\n\nmistake. —Michael Steinhardt\n\nI’ve been asked, “How do you know when you’re wrong?” My answer is\nalways, “The stock goes down.” It’s that simple. As a matter of fact, I will\noften sell a stock if it doesn’t go up shortly after I buy it. Even though it has\nnot gone down, if the stock doesn’t do what I expected it to do, that’s rea-\nson enough to step aside and reevaluate. When a stock you have bought\nfalls below your purchase price, it is telling you have made an error—at a\nminimum in timing. Make no mistake, whether you’re a short-term trader\n\n\fC H A P T E R   1 2   R I S K   M A N A G E M E N T   P A R T   1\n\nor a long-term investor, timing is everything. Just as much money is lost on\ngreat companies bought at the wrong time as on investments that were poor\nchoices in the ﬁrst place. Regardless of your methodology or approach\nto stock investing, there is only one way to protect your portfolio from a\nlarge loss, and that is to sell when you have a small loss before it snowballs\ninto a huge one. In three decades of trading, I have not found a better way. Amazingly, no matter how many successful investors advocate this\ncommonsense approach, this advice is followed only by an extremely small\ngroup of people even among professionals. Consequently, only a very small\nnumber of investors (including pros) achieve outstanding results in the\nstock market. Without a doubt, the hardest discipline for investors to fol-\nlow consistently is to cut their losses short because it involves admitting that\none’s original purchase was a mistake, and no one likes to be wrong. Avoid the Big Errors\n\nWhat vulnerabilities do we have and what can we do to minimize\n\nthem, to get around them, to survive them—and give ourselves a\n\nbetter chance to win”\n\n—Bobby Knight\n\nRecently I had a chance to speak with Itzhak Ben-David, coauthor of the\nstudy Are Investors Really Reluctant to Realize Their Losses? Trading Responses\nto Past Returns and the Disposition Effect. The tendency to sell winners too\nsoon and to keep losers too long has been called the disposition effect by\neconomists. Mr. Ben-David and David Hirshleifer studied stock transactions from\nmore than 77,000 accounts at a large discount broker from 1990 through\n1996 and did a variety of analyses that had never been done before. They\nexamined when investors bought individual stocks, when they sold them,\nand how much they earned or lost with each sale. They also examined when\ninvestors were more likely to buy additional shares of a stock they had pre-\nviously purchased. Their results were published in the August 2012 issue of\nthe Review of Financial Studies. T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\nThe study highlights several interesting conclusions:\n\n(cid:115)(cid:0)\n\nInvestors are more likely to allow a stock to reach a large loss than\nthey are to allow a stock to attain a large gain; they hold losers too\nlong and sell winners too quickly. (cid:115)(cid:0) The probability of buying additional shares is greater for shares\nthat have lost value than it is for shares that have gained value;\ninvestors may readily double down on their bets when stocks\ndecline in value. (cid:115)(cid:0)\n\nInvestors are more likely to take a small gain than a small loss. Most investors are simply too slow in closing out losing positions. As a\nresult, they hold on until they can’t take the pain anymore, and that eats up\nprecious capital and valuable time. To be successful, you must keep in mind\nthat the only way you can continue to operate is to protect your account\nfrom a major setback or, worse, devastation. Avoiding large losses is the\nsingle most important factor for winning big as a speculator. You can’t\ncontrol how much a stock rises, but in most cases, whether you take a\nsmall loss or a big loss is entirely your choice.

In stud poker\n\nand on Wall Street, miracles happen just often enough to keep the\n\nlosers losing. —Peter Lynch, One Up on Wall Street\n\nThe  ﬁrst  time  I  saw  seven-card  stud  being  played  at  a  casino,  it  didn’t\ntake me more than a few minutes to see the similarities to trading stocks. The ante (the initial bet to see the ﬁrst three cards of the deal) was $0.50. However, the pot (what the winner pulled in for a winning hand) averaged\nabout $50. Thus, for half a buck, players could get a fair idea of their chances\nof winning 100 times the ante. After a night at the table, I was ahead about $1,400. My secret? I played\ncards the way I trade stocks: immediately folding the ones that didn’t work\nout as expected. If I didn’t receive a decent playable hand on the deal, I\ndidn’t continue betting against the other players. I tossed in my cards and\naccepted the small loss of $0.50 as the cost of doing business. I knew that\nwhen I had a winning hand, I could make back the amount of my loss many\ntimes over. I probably folded 30 hands in a row at times, which at $0.50 an\n\nT R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\nante meant a $15 loss. But the average winning pot was $50. If I folded 50\ntimes and won only once, I would still win twice as much as I lost. Why didn’t the other players fold when I played a hand after realizing\nthat I went forward only when I had solid cards? Ego! Big ego equals small\ndiscipline. Undisciplined players looking for “action” always show up at the\npoker tables. The stock market is no different except that most stock market\ninvestors are even less disciplined than most poker players. The Achilles’ heel\nof most gamblers and speculators is the desire to play every hand, a com-\nmon human weakness that allows impatience to override good judgment. Folding mediocre cards at the poker table is the same as selling off stocks\nsoon after they fall below your purchase price to protect your account. Losing trades are inevitable. By limiting your losses, you will put yourself\nway ahead of the majority of investors because most investors lack disci-\npline. The best traders are the ones who recognize mistakes, dispassionately\ncut their losses, and move on, preserving capital for the next opportunity. One in a Million\n\nAs a trader, which is the better deal, $1,000 guaranteed or $1 million with\na 1 percent chance of losing everything? It’s really not an either-or answer. Notice the key words “as a trader.” Now think about something: If you were\na lawyer, would you go to trial just once? If you were a surgeon, would you\nconduct just one operation? As a stock trader, are your decisions based on\na one-time event? Of course not. As a stock trader, you probably will make\nhundreds if not thousands of stock transactions over your lifetime. The answer to the question is that if it’s a one-time event, take the mil-\nlion. However, if it involves many trades, say, 100 or more transactions, the\n1 percent probability will deﬁnitely leave you broke; hence, take the sure\nthing: the $1,000. If you’re going to become a stock trader, you will be trading for years,\nmaybe even decades. If you regard each trade as just one out of a million over\ntime, it becomes much easier to take a small loss and move on to the next\ntrade.

All I can do is share with\nyou what I know from my own success and tell you that the stock market is no\nplace for someone who is easily discouraged by mistakes. Mistakes are lessons,\nin other words, opportunities to improve. These experiences are the greatest\npart of the learning process. Although cutting your losses won’t guarantee that\nyou will win in the stock market, it will help ensure your survival. Why Most Investors Fail to Cut Their Losses\n\nInvestors usually become emotionally attached to their stock holdings. They\nmay put in many hours of careful research building a case for a company,\nscouring ﬁnancial reports, and maybe even trying the company’s products. Then, when their proud pick takes a dive, they can’t believe it. They make\n\nT R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\nexcuses for the stock’s decline; they call their broker and search the Internet\nlooking for favorable opinions to back up their faith in the company. They\nignore the only opinion that counts: the verdict of the market. As the stock keeps sliding, their losses mount. Usually, what happens\nis that the stock’s decline becomes so huge and unbearable that they ﬁnally\nthrow in the towel and feel completely demoralized. Don’t allow yourself to\nget caught in this lethal trap. To have lasting success in the stock market,\nyou must decide once and for all that it’s more important to make money\nthan to be right. Your ego must take a backseat. Sounds like a simple decision to make, but think again. Many people\nspeculate in stocks without getting this one straight. Their self-image rides\non the success or failure of their trades. As a result, they make excuses for\nobvious losers rather than admit mistakes. Ultimately, the success of cutting\nlosses rests on your ability to remove emotion—hope, fear, pride, excite-\nment, and the like—from your investment decisions, at least to the point\nwhere it doesn’t override good judgment. Most investors fall into psychological traps. Feelings of hope and greed\nconfuse their decisions to sell their stock holdings at a loss or, for that mat-\nter, at a proﬁt. They ﬁnd it difﬁcult to sell, and so they rationalize a losing\nposition. They convince themselves that they haven’t taken the loss until\nthey sell it. Losses are a part of trading and investing; if you are not pre-\npared to deal with them, then prepare to eventually lose a lot of money. As you can see, I devoted two chapters to risk management. That’s\nbecause in trading and in life, how you deal with losing is the difference\nbetween mediocrity and greatness. Individual stocks are not like mutual\nfunds, they don’t have a manager and they don’t manage themselves;\nyou’re the manager. When investing in stocks, everything is not necessarily\ngoing to be “OK” if you just hang in there and wait it out. For a speculator,\nsmall losses are simply the cost of doing business, just as marked-down mer-\nchandise is to a retail store operator. A good retail merchant doesn’t hang\non to dead merchandise, hoping a particular style or product will come back\nin vogue a year later. If he’s smart, he marks it down, gets it off the shelf as\nquickly as possible, and then looks to restock the shelves with something\nthat everyone wants to buy.

When the stock\nthen sank to $16, you asked yourself, Why didn’t I sell it at $26 or even $32\nwhen I had the chance to get out with a small loss?

Making a habit of doing the things that produce positive\nresults is worthwhile, but it requires the principle of greatness: discipline. Contingency Planning\n\nSuccess is never ﬁnal. —Winston Churchill\n\nIn the stock market and in life, risk is unavoidable. The best anyone can do\nis to manage risk through sensible planning. The only way to control risk\nwhen investing in stocks is through how much we buy and sell, when we\nbuy and sell, and how we prepare for as many potential events as possible. As a stock market investor, you must learn to sell for your own protection\nbecause you have no control over the forces that move stock prices. Your\ngoal is not risk avoidance but risk management: to mitigate risk and have\na signiﬁcant degree of control over the possibility and amount of loss. I don’t like to leave anything to chance in my trading. If I go into a\ncasino and play blackjack, I know what the odds are, and if I feel like taking\na chance, that’s the best I can hope for. But I don’t gamble with stock trad-\ning, which would be rolling the dice with my livelihood and my security. The best way to ensure stock market success is to have contingency plans\n\nT R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\nand continuously update them as you learn and encounter new scenarios.

The mark of a professional is proper preparation. To execute, you must\nbe prepared.

If and when new circumstances pres-\nent themselves, I add them to my contingency plans; as new unexpected\nissues present themselves, the contingency plan playbook is expanded. By implementing contingency planning in advance, you can take swift,\ndecisive action the instant one of your positions changes its behavior or\nis hit with an unexpected event. You should also be prepared to deal with\nproﬁts when they come to fruition. Before the open of each trading day,\nmentally rehearse how you will handle each position based on whatever\ncould potentially unfold during that day. Then, when the market opens\nfor trading, there will be no surprises; you already know how you will\nrespond. You should run your portfolio the way an airline pilot operates a 747\njumbo jet. To ensure the safe passage of the ﬂight, the pilot has advance\nplans for every possible contingency: engine failure, severe weather condi-\ntions, hydraulic malfunction, and hundreds of other mechanical or elec-\ntronic problems. The pilot has considered possibilities ranging from an\nelectrical storm to trouble with one of the passengers. When a problem\noccurs, there is no debate or delay. For every eventuality, the pilot has a\nprocedure or countermeasure. This comes from training and preparation. When we’re not prepared, we’re vulnerable. September 11, 2001, was a\ngrim reminder of the importance of proper preparation. As a result, cockpit\ndoors are now fortiﬁed, and the sky marshal program put into place during\nthe 1960s has been expanded. Some pilots are even armed. Learning from\nour past mistakes and being properly prepared allow for safer travel and for\nsafer investing as well. I have the following four basic contingency plans for my stock trading. C H A P T E R   1 3   R I S K   M A N A G E M E N T   P A R T   2\n\nThe Initial Stop-Loss\nBefore buying a stock, I establish in advance a maximum stop loss: the price\nat which I will exit the position if it moves against me. The moment the price\nhits the stop loss, I sell the position without hesitation. Once I’m out of the\nstock, I can evaluate the situation with a clear head. The initial stop loss is\nmost relevant in the early stages of a position. Once a stock advances, the sell\npoint should be raised to protect your proﬁt with the use of a trailing stop\nor back stop. The Reentry\nSome stocks set up constructively and may even emerge from a promis-\ning base and attract buyers but then quickly undergo a correction or sharp\npullback that stops you out. This tends to occur when the market is expe-\nriencing general weakness or high volatility. However, a stock with strong\nfundamentals can reset after such a correction or pullback, forming a new\nbase or a proper setup. This show of strength is a favorable sign. Often, the\nsecond setup is stronger than the ﬁrst. The stock has fought its way back and\nalong the way shaken out another batch of weak holders. If it breaks out of\nthe second base on high volume, it can really take off. You shouldn’t assume that a stock will reset if it moves against you. You should always protect yourself and cut your loss. However, if a stock\nknocks you out of your position, don’t automatically discard it as a future\nbuy candidate. If the stock still has all the characteristics of a potential\nwinner, look for a reentry point. Your timing may have been off. It could\ntake two or even three tries to catch a big winner. This is a trait of profes-\nsional traders. Amateurs are scared of positions that stop them out once\nor twice or just weary of the struggle; professionals are objective and\ndispassionate. They assess each trade on its merits of risk versus reward;\nthey look at each trade setup as a new risk or a new opportunity. Some\nbelieve that selling a stock and then reentering the same stock soon after-\nward is amateurish. I believe missing opportunity because of emotion is\nas amateurish. Managing risk with the use of stop losses, particularly in a\nwhipsaw market, can sometimes give a trader the feeling of chasing one’s\ntail.

Some of my best trades were in stocks that previously stopped me out sev-\neral times and then reset. Selling at a Profit\nOnce a stock amasses a percentage gain that is a multiple of your stop loss,\nyou should rarely allow that position to turn into a loss. For instance, let’s\nsay your stop loss is set at 7 percent. If you have a 20 percent gain in a stock,\nyou shouldn’t allow that position to give up all that proﬁt and produce a\nloss. To guard against that, you could move up your stop loss to breakeven\nor trail a stop to lock in the majority of the gain. You may feel foolish break-\ning even on a position that was previously a decent gain; however, you will\nfeel even worse if you let a nice gain turn into a loss.

In fact, that’s probably a safe bet; the disaster plan deals\nwith such issues as what to do if your Internet connection goes down or\nyour power fails. Do you have a backup system? What will your response\nbe if you wake up and learn that the stock you bought yesterday is set to gap\ndown huge because the company is being investigated by the Securities and\nExchange Commission and the CEO has skipped the country with embez-\nzled funds? What will you do? The importance contingency planning plays is that it enables you to\nmake good decisions when you’re under ﬁre, when you need it the most. To survive in the stock market over the long term, I run my portfolio as if\nsomething really bad were going to happen every day. I am always prepared\nfor the worst-case scenario. Contingency planning allows you to have a psychological strategy that is\nas robust as your trading strategy as well as a trading strategy that has built-\nin responses to potential situations that could, if you are not prepared, lead\nto competing thoughts at the precise time you need to implement instant\nunbiased action. Contingency planning is an ongoing process. As you expe-\nrience new problems, a procedure should be created to deal with them,\nwhich then becomes part of your contingency plans. You’re never going to\nhave all the answers, but you can cover most of the bases to the point where\nyour reward outweighs your risk, and that’s the key.

Just as an insurance company utilizes mortality tables, you can use a\nsimilar method for your trading as I have done for for mine for many years.

Similarly, your losses are\na direct function of the mortality tables of your gains and where they tend\nto expire on average. To make money consistently, you need a positive mathematical expec-\ntation for return; you need an edge. That is, your reward/risk ratio must be\ngreater than one to one (net of costs). To achieve this, your losses obviously\nneed to be contained on average to a level lower than that of your gains. During my 30 years trading tens of thousands of stocks, I have been\ncorrect on winning trades only about 50 percent of the time. I’m wrong just\nas often as I’m right as far as wins and losses go; however, though the losses\nmay be the same or at times even greater in number, the dollar amounts the\nproﬁtable trades have been much larger than the losses on average. Imagine:\nbeing wrong just as often as being right allowed me to amass a fortune. This\nis because I follow a very important rule: always keep your risk at a level that\nis less than that of your average gain. At What Point Should You Cut a Loss? As I’ve just discussed, the level at which a trader should cut his losses is\nnot arbitrary. Loss cutting is a function of expected gain.

Let’s assume that a trader is proﬁtable on 50 percent of his trades. Therefore, he must on average make at least as much as he loses to break\neven over time. Although going forward these numbers can only be based\non assumption, it’s the average gain from your actual trades that’s the key\nnumber. After you have calculated these numbers, you will be able to get a\nmuch clearer picture of where you should be cutting your losses. A rule of\nthumb could be to cut your losses at a level of one-half of  your average gain. In the words of Warren Buffett, “Take the probability of loss times the\namount of possible loss from the probability of gain times the amount of\npossible gain. .", "char_count": 2394, "word_count": 455, "created_at": "2025-11-01T06:08:54.610354Z"}

It’s imperfect, but that’s what it’s all about.”\n\nAvoid the Trader’s Cardinal Sin\n\nAllowing your loss on a trade to exceed your average gain is what I call the\ntrader’s cardinal sin. You must make more on your winners than you lose\non your losers, remember? How can you possibly make money over time\nunless your winners return more dollars than your losers lose? The fact is\nthat most traders don’t even know what their average gain is. When setting\na stop loss, I have a rule of thumb that the amount of loss should be no more\nthan one-half the amount of expected gain based on one’s real-life trading\nresults. For example, if your winning trades produce a gain of 15 percent on\naverage, you should sell any declining stock at no more than 7.5 percent off\nthe purchase price. If you buy a stock at $30 a share, you would set your ini-\ntial stop loss at $27.75. I also suggest that most investors, no matter how large their average\ngains, not allow any stock to fall more than 10 percent before selling. If you\ncan’t time a purchase well enough that you need more than 10 percent ﬂuc-\ntuation from your point of purchase, something is wrong with your timing\nand selection criteria. Let’s say that you sell your winners for an average gain\n\nT R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\nof 30 percent. I would not recommend allowing losses of 15 percent even\nthough that would be half of your expected gain. In my experience, a 10 per-\ncent decline signals that something is wrong with the trade, assuming that\nyou purchased it correctly in the ﬁrst place. Over time your average gain will improve as you learn how to trade\nmore effectively. You should monitor your average gain on a regular basis\nand make adjustments to your stop loss accordingly. However, keep in mind\nthat there’s also an absolute level at which you need to cut your loss: the\n“uncle point.” When you were a kid, someone would twist your arm until\nyou couldn’t take it anymore and said “uncle,” meaning, “Okay, I’ve had\nenough; I surrender.” Next time you allow a loss to grow larger than your\naverage gain, ask yourself how you can you be proﬁtable if your losses are\nbigger than your gains. The best thing you can do is to keep your losses small in relation to your\ngains. With more experience, you will become a more effective trader. You’ll\nrealize larger gains on average and have more money to reinvest. Improved\ntrading skills will compound your trading account, but only if you keep\nyour losses small and avoid the trader’s cardinal sin. Never let a loss grow\nlarger than your average gain. Building in Failure\n\nI have always lived by the following philosophy: expect the best and plan for\nthe worst. Systems that rely on a high percentage of proﬁtable trades never\nimpressed me very much; they expect the best and plan for the best. I always\nfelt that they were too risky if something went wrong and they lost their\nedge. The end result may be the same during periods when things are going\nalong normally. However, if a trader has to be right on 70 or 80 percent of\nhis trades and that’s his edge, what happens if he’s right only 40 or 50 per-\ncent of the time during a difﬁcult period? What about during a really difﬁ-\ncult period? The problem with relying on a high percentage of proﬁtable\ntrades is that no adjustment can be made; you can’t control the number of\nwins and losses. What you can control is your stop loss; you can tighten it\nup as your gains get squeezed during difﬁcult periods. C H A P T E R   1 3   R I S K   M A N A G E M E N T   P A R T   2\n\nI like to keep my risk/reward ratio intact so that I can have a relatively\nlow batting average and still not get into serious trouble. It’s a concept that\nI call building in failure. My goal is to maintain at least a 2:1 win/loss ratio\nwith an absolute maximum stop loss of no more than10 percent. I shoot for\n3:1, and I’m elated if I can attain this ratio with even a 50 percent batting\naverage. This means I’m making money three times faster on my wins than\nI’m losing when I’m wrong. At a 2:1 ratio, I can be right only one-third of\nthe time and still not get into real trouble. At a 3:1 ratio, even a 40 percent\nbatting average could yield a fortune. If I’m able to be proﬁtable with such a\nlow percentage of winning trades, I’ve built a lot of failure into the system. Always Determine Your Risk in Advance\n\nThe time to think most clearly about where you will exit a position is before\nyou get in. By the time you purchase a stock, the price at which you will sell\nat a loss should already be determined. When a stock drops to your defen-\nsive sell line, there is no time for vacillating or second-guessing. There is\nno decision to be made; it’s been decided ahead of time. You just carry\nout your plan; you should write down your sell price before you buy each\nstock. Put it on a Post-it and attach it to your computer screen.", "char_count": 4896, "word_count": 936, "created_at": "2025-11-01T06:08:54.610354Z"}

As far as I’m concerned, if you aren’t willing to cut losses, you\nshould not be managing your investments or anyone else’s. Most investors\ncan’t stand to take losses.

My trading results went from mediocre to outstanding once I ﬁnally\nmade the decision to draw a line in the sand and vowed never again to let\na loss get out of control. I suggest that you make that same commitment\nright now. You should handle a falling stock in your portfolio the way a doctor treats\nan incoming patient in the emergency room. If an accident victim just got\nrushed into the ER and had lost a great amount of blood, the doctor would act\nquickly to stop the loss because the more the patient bleeds, the more likely it\nis that he will not recover.", "char_count": 1564, "word_count": 299, "created_at": "2025-11-01T06:08:54.610354Z"}

Your predetermined stop-loss point should be used as an absolute max-\nimum. Once the stock has declined to your stop, sell it immediately without\nexception or hesitation. Nothing must prevent you from getting out of the\nposition. Unfortunately, most investors don’t have a stop, even fewer write\nit down, and many do not sell when the stop is triggered. Typically, a stock\ndeclines and the investor says, “On the next rally I’ll get out.” Then one of\ntwo things happens. The stock rallies and in many cases these investors still\ndon’t sell because they feel comfortable that the stock is ﬁne again, or the\nstock never rallies but keeps falling and becomes even more difﬁcult to sell. If you want to achieve superperformance in stocks, praying and hoping\nfor a stock to recover from a loss has no place in your psychology. The mar-\nket doesn’t care about what you hope will happen. Inevitably, traders who\nthink this way continually repeat the error of holding losses “just this once”\nand end up with mediocre or losing records of performance in the market. In fact, such traders frequently go bust.

My advice is to get out\nimmediately. Take whatever the next bid price is. Such a hard-falling stock\nis sending a warning. One money manager I know badly mishandled this type of scenario\nwith a large position. A stock dropped quickly on news and shot well below\nher predetermined sell price; she was quickly down 15 percent on the posi-\ntion. She called me and asked my opinion. Of course, I told her I would have\nalready sold if the stock had gone through my stop loss. She instructed her\nportfolio manager to wait for the stock to come back and then sell when they\nwere down only 5 percent. The stock never came back. In fact, it fell further,\nand they ended up taking a 60 percent thrashing before they ﬁnally threw in\nthe towel. Does this sound familiar? Sure, there are going to be many times when you sell a stock that’s down\nand it comes right back up. So what!

Perhaps your stock-selection criteria are missing a\nkey factor. If you experience an abnormal losing streak, ﬁrst scale down your\nexposure. Don’t try to trade larger to recoup your losses fast; that can lead\nto much bigger losses. Instead, cut down your position sizes; for example, if\nyou normally trade 5,000-share lots, trade 2,000 shares. If you continue to\nhave trouble, cut back again, maybe to 1,000 shares. If it continues, cut back\nagain. When your trading plan is working well, do the opposite and pyra-\nmid back up. Following this strategy will help keep you from trading yourself into\nthe ground when things turn sour, which they deﬁnitely will at some point. When you take a large loss or get hit repeatedly, there’s a tendency to get\nangry and try to get it back quickly by trading larger.

Learn to Pace Yourself\n\nWhen I come out of a 100 percent cash position, generally after a bear mar-\nket or intermediate-term correction, I rarely jump right in with both feet. I think of each trading year as the opener of a twelve-inning game. There’s\nplenty of time to reach my goal. Early on, I take it slow with my main focus\non avoiding major errors and ﬁnding the market’s theme. This is like an\nathlete warming up and assessing the competitive environment. Themes\ncan come in the form of how prices are acting in general, industry group\n\nT R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\nleadership, overall market tone, and economic and political inﬂuences. I\ntry to establish a rhythm and set my pace during this time. Like a golfer\nwho has found his swing groove, once I ﬁnd a theme and establish my trad-\ning rhythm, then and only then do I step up my exposure signiﬁcantly. I\nwait patiently for the right opportunity while guarding my account. When\nthe opportunity presents itself with the least chance of loss, I’m ready to\nstrike. Patience is the key. My goal is to trade effortlessly. If your trading is\ncausing you difﬁculty or stress, something is wrong with your criteria or\ntiming or you’re trading too large. To trade with ease, you must learn to\nwait patiently until the wind is at your back. If you were going sailing, you\nwouldn’t go out on a dead calm and sit there ﬂoating in the water all day\nwaiting for the wind to pick up. Why not just wait for a breezy day to set sail? Build on Success\n\nI view the objectives in trading as a three-tiered hierarchy. First\n\nand foremost is the preservation of capital. When I ﬁrst look at a\n\ntrade, I don’t ask, “What is the potential proﬁt I can realize?” but\n\nrather, “What is the potential loss I could suffer?” Second, I strive\n\nfor consistent proﬁtability by balancing my risk relative to the\n\naccumulated proﬁts or losses. Consistency is far more important\n\nthan making lots of money. Third, insofar as I’m successful in\n\nthe ﬁrst two goals, I attempt to achieve superior returns. I do this\n\nby increasing my bet size after, and only after, periods of high\n\nproﬁtability. In other words, if I have had a particularly proﬁtable\n\nrecent period, I may try to pyramid my gains by placing a larger bet\n\nsize assuming, of course, the right situation presents itself. The key\n\nto building wealth is to preserve capital and wait patiently for the\n\nright opportunity to make extraordinary gains. —Victor Sperandeo\n\nTo make big money in the stock market you do not have to make all-or-\nnothing decisions. Stock trading is not an on-off business; moving from\ncash into equities should be incremental. As emerging stocks multiply on\n\n\fC H A P T E R   1 3   R I S K   M A N A G E M E N T   P A R T   2\n\nyour watch list and the market tries to rally off its apparent lows, the time\nwill come to test the water with real money. Prudence is the order of the\nday here. You should start off with “pilot buys” by initiating smaller posi-\ntions than normal; if they work out, larger positions should be added to the\nportfolio soon thereafter. This toe-in-the-water approach helps keep you\nout of trouble and building on your successes. If you’re not proﬁtable at 25\npercent or 50 percent invested, why move up to 75 percent or 100 percent\ninvested or use margin? Wait for conﬁrmation and require that at least a\nfew trades work out before getting more aggressive. Conversely, if your trades are not working as expected, cut back. There’s\nno intelligent reason to increase your trading size if your positions are show-\ning losses. By pyramiding up when you’re trading well and tapering off\nwhen you’re trading poorly, you trade your largest when trading your\nbest and trade your smallest when trading your worst. This is how you\nmake big money as well as protect yourself from disaster. Before stepping\nup my exposure aggressively, I look to my portfolio for conﬁrmation.

Scaling In versus Averaging Down\n\nA key difference between professionals and amateurs is that professionals\nscale into positions whereas amateurs average down. What do I mean by\nthis? Let’s assume that both the professional and the amateur decide to risk\n5 percent of their capital on a trade. The pro may scale in with 2 percent on\nthe ﬁrst buy, 2 percent on the second, and maybe an additional 1 percent on\nthe third. He then might put his stop at 10 percent from the average cost of\nhis three buys, risking 0.50 percent of the total account capital. The amateur buys his position, usually at one price, and if the trade\ngoes against him, he may decide to average down, doubling up on a losing\nposition. Often amateurs double up several times.

If the stock keeps sinking, it becomes even more difﬁcult to sell\nbecause you kept committing to the stock with additional buys. In my trad-\ning, I try to buy or add to a position in the direction of the trade only after it\nhas shown me a proﬁt; even if I’m buying a pullback, I generally wait for the\nstock to turn up before going long. The lesson: never trust the ﬁrst price\nunless the position shows you a proﬁt. When to Move Up Your Stop\n\nI have some basic general guidelines: Any stock that rises to a multiple of my\nstop loss should never be allowed to go into the loss column. When the price\nof a stock I own rises by three times my risk, I almost always move my stop\nup to at least breakeven. Suppose I buy a stock at $50 and decide that I’m\nwilling to risk 5 percent on the trade ($47.50 stop loss for a $2.50 risk). If the\nstock advances to $57.50 (3 (cid:3) $2.50), I move my stop to at least $50. If the\nstock continues to rise, I start to look for an opportunity to sell on the way\nup and nail down my proﬁt. If I get stopped out at breakeven, I still have my\ncapital; nothing gained but nothing lost. You may feel dumb breaking even\non a trade that was once at a proﬁt; however, you’ll feel a lot worse if you\nturn a good-size gain into a loser. Move your stop up when your stock rises\nby two or three times your risk, especially if that number is above your his-\ntorical average gain. This will help guard you against losses and protect your\nproﬁts and your conﬁdence. Not All Ratios Are Created Equal\n\nYou may have heard that in setting a stop loss you should allow more room\nfor volatile price action; you should widen your stops on the basis of the\nvolatility of the underlying stock.

During difﬁcult\nperiods, your gains will be smaller than normal and your percentage of prof-\nitable trades (your batting average) will deﬁnitely be lower than usual, and\nso your losses must be cut shorter to compensate. It would be fair to assume\nthat in difﬁcult trading periods your batting average is likely to fall below\n\n\fC H A P T E R   1 3   R I S K   M A N A G E M E N T   P A R T   2\n\n50 percent. Once your batting average drops below 50 percent, increasing\nyour risk proportionately to compensate for a higher expected gain based\non higher volatility will eventually cause you to hit negative expectancy;\nthe more your batting average drops, the sooner negative expectancy will\nbe achieved. As the next ﬁgure illustrates, at a 40 percent batting average your opti-\nmal gain/loss ratio is 20 percent/10 percent; at this ratio your return on\ninvestment (ROI) over 10 trades is 10.2 percent. Note that the expected\nreturn  rises  from  left  to  right  and  peaks  at  this  ratio. Thereafter,  with\nincreasing losses in proportion to your gains, the return actually declines. Armed with this knowledge, you can understand which ratio at a particular\nbatting average will yield the best expected return. This illustrates the power\nof ﬁnding the optimal ratio. Any less and you make less money; however,\nany more and you also make less money. If your winning trades were to more than double from 20 percent to 42\npercent and you maintained a 2:1 gain/loss ratio by cutting your losses at 21\n\nFigure 13.1  Total compounded return per 10 trades at various batting\n\naverages\n\nT R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\npercent instead of 10 percent, you would actually lose money. You’re still\nmaintaining the same ratio, so how could you be losing? This is the danger-\nous nature of losses; they work geometrically against you. At a 50 percent\nbatting average, if you made 100 percent on your winners and lost 50 per-\ncent on your losers, you would do nothing but break even; you would make\nmore money taking proﬁts at 4 percent and cutting your losses at 2 percent. Not surprisingly, as your batting average drops, it gets much worse. At a 30\npercent batting average, proﬁting 100 percent on your winners and giving\nback 50 percent on your losers, you would have a whopping 93 percent loss\nin just 10 trades. If the optimal result is achieved by having a 48 percent/24 percent win/\nloss ratio at a 50 percent batting average, what do you think happens when\nyour percentage of proﬁtable trades drops to only 40 percent? The follow-\ning ﬁgure may surprise you by showing that the optimal level drops to 20\npercent/10 percent. If you’re trading poorly and your batting average is dropping off\nbelow the 50% level, the last thing you want to do is increase the room you\ngive your stocks on the downside. This is not an opinion; it’s a mathemati-\ncal fact. Many investors give their losing positions more freedom to inﬂict\n\nFigure 13.2  Total compounded return per 10 trades at 40 percent batting\n\naverage\n\n\fC H A P T E R   1 3   R I S K   M A N A G E M E N T   P A R T   2\n\ndeeper losses. Their results begin to slip, and they get knocked out of a hand-\nful of trades; then they watch the stocks they sold at a loss turn around and\ngo back up. What do they say to themselves? “Maybe I should have given the\nstock more room to ﬂuctuate; I’d still be in it.” This is just the opposite of\nwhat you should do. In a difﬁcult market environment, proﬁts will be smaller than normal\nand losses will be larger; downside gaps will be more common, and you will\nmost likely experience greater slippage. The smart way to handle this is to\ndo the following:\n\n(cid:115)(cid:0) Tighten up stop losses. If you normally cut losses at 7 to 8 percent,\n\ncut them at 5 to 6 percent. (cid:115)(cid:0) Settle for smaller proﬁts. If you normally take proﬁts of 15 to 20\n\npercent on average, take proﬁts at 10 to12 percent. (cid:115)(cid:0)\n\nIf you’re trading with the use of leverage, get off margin\nimmediately. (cid:115)(cid:0) Reduce your exposure with regard to your position sizes as well as\n\nyour overall capital commitment. (cid:115)(cid:0) Once you see your batting average and risk/reward proﬁle\n\nimprove, you can start to extend your parameters gradually back\nto normal levels. Diversification Does Not Protect You\n\nI’ve always felt that if I was enthusiastic about an industry or a\n\ncompany, then I would concentrate in it. It causes commentators to\n\nconsider me risky. I never thought that was risk; I thought that was\n\nopportunity. —Kenneth Heebner\n\nDiversiﬁcation is a tactic used to distribute investments among different\nsecurities to limit losses in the event of a decline in a particular security\n\nT R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D\n\nor industry. The strategy relies on the average security having a proﬁt-\nable expected value. Diversiﬁcation also provides some psychological ben-\neﬁts to single-instrument trading since some of the short-term variation\nin one instrument may cancel out that from another instrument, resulting\nin an overall smoothing of short-term portfolio volatility. You will never\nachieve superperformance if you overly diversify and rely on diversi-\nﬁcation for protection. During a bear market, almost all stocks will go\ndown. By having your money spread all over the place, you accomplish\nthree things:\n\n1. Inability to follow each company closely and know everything you\n\nshould know about the investments\n\n2. Inability to reduce your portfolio exposure quickly when needed\n\n3. A smoothing effect that will ensure average results\n\nDepending on the size of your portfolio and your risk tolerance, you\nshould typically have between 4 and 6 stocks, and for large portfolios maybe\nas many as 10 or 12 stocks. This will provide sufﬁcient diversiﬁcation but\nnot too much. You should not hold more than 20 positions, which would\nrepresent a 5 percent position size if they were equally weighted. All during\nmy trading career I’ve heard over and over, “You have to be diversiﬁed.” If\nKen Heebner of CGM Funds can move around billions of dollars in just 20\nnames and still manage to beat the market, a personal portfolio can surely\nbe managed sufﬁciently with a maximum of 10 to 20 stocks. If you’re a true\n2:1 trader, mathematically your optimal position size should be 25 percent\n(four stocks divided equally). As a result, a stock that is a big winner will\nmake a real contribution to your portfolio. In keeping track of 4, 5, or 6 com-\npanies, it is much easier to know a lot about each name than it is to follow\nand track 15 or 20 companies. If you’re holding many positions, it’s going\nto be difﬁcult to raise cash and move quickly when the market turns against\nyou. Instead of spreading yourself all over the place in a feeble attempt to\nmitigate risk through diversiﬁcation, concentrate your capital in the very\n\n\fC H A P T E R   1 3   R I S K   M A N A G E M E N T   P A R T   2\n\nbest stocks—a relatively small group—that have exciting things going on. Watch your stocks carefully and be prepared to move if things take a turn\nfor the worse. In  my  career,  I  have  had  many  periods  in  which  I  put  my  entire\naccount in just four names.

Using his SEPA trading strategy, in a ﬁve-year period Minervini gen-\nerated a towering 220 percent average annual return with only one losing\nquarter. To put that in perspective, a $100,000 account would explode to\nover $30 million with those returns. Mark Minervini is a 30-year veteran of Wall Street. He is featured in Jack\nSchwager’s Stock Market Wizards: Conversations with America’s Top Stock\nTraders. Schwager wrote: “Minervini’s performance has been nothing short\nof astounding. Most traders and money managers would be delighted to\nhave Minervini’s worst year—a 128 percent gain—as their best.”\n\nCurrently, Minervini educates traders about his SEPA trading meth-\nodology through a service called Minervini Private Access, a streaming\ncommunication platform that allows users the unique experience of trad-\ning side-by-side with Minervini in real time.
