One key factor affecting the\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\ndifferent layer types.", "metadata": {"source": "attention_is_all_you_need_annotated.md"}, "chunk_index": 28}

In terms of\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\n\n\n6\n\n\nlength _n_ is smaller than the representation dimensionality _d_, which is most often the case with\nsentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\n\n[38] and byte-pair [31] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size _r_ in\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position.
