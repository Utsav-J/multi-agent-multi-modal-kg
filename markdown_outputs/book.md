Foreword

I n  my  40  years  of  investing I have read numerous investment

books, and you would think that I would have a large library ﬁlled
with them. The truth is that my collection is quite small, because so few
investment books are worth keeping. To the handful that are worth reading,
one I am adding to my library is Trade Like a Stock Market Wizard by Mark
Minervini. Mark’s book has to be on every investor’s bookshelf. It is about
the most comprehensive work I have ever read on investing in growth stocks
and includes vital details not found in other popular books on that subject.
Some investment books cover only the fundamental aspects of investing,
and others cover only the technical aspects, Mark’s book combines the most
important factors that could help you ﬁnd superperformance stocks in the
future. Everyone wants to own the next Apple Computer, Costco, or Home
Depot, and Mark shows you what to look for.

Mark took years to research the methods that have made him successful.
He has dug up gems of investing knowledge from some of the great invest-
ment books and research most investors never knew existed. For example, a
source he cites is Superperformance Stocks by Richard Love. When you com-
bine that with the experience he gained through many market cycles, you
have a book packed with vital advice that will help any investor. In each
chapter, Mark clearly lays out the factors that are important for a success-
ful investment. It is one of those books you have to reread to really grasp all
that it contains

One of the best sections of the book is Mark’s description of the life cycle
of a growth stock. You get a fundamental and technical picture of where a
stock is along the different phases of its move from the start in phase 1, to

ix

x

F O R E W O R D

the acceleration of earnings and price performance in phase 2, to the topping
process in phase 3, to the trip back down in price as earnings slow in phase 4.
He shows this not only with price charts but with tables of earnings and sales
to show what is happening fundamentally as a growth stock moves over time.
In the last two chapters of the book, which you should probably read
ﬁrst, Mark discusses risk management. This is vital because so many inves-
tors seem to get into the right stocks but don’t know how to take a proﬁt or
when to sell as a position goes against them. He discusses the psychological
factors that prevent most investors from cutting a loss. Can you believe that
an investor of Mark’s stature is right only 50 percent of the time and has still
made a fortune! That is due to his use of risk management.

I have always believed that to be a successful investor you have a large
tuition bill to pay in hard losses at the University of Wall Street before you
can graduate and start making money. Mark supplies the best textbook on
growth stock investing, and so you can avoid paying such a high tuition.
With his help, a determined effort, and discipline, you can get an Ivy League
education for the cost of a hardcover book. If you are a seasoned inves-
tor this book is a graduate-level class that will certainly add to your invest-
ment knowledge, as it has mine. Mark has also saved me a great deal of time
because he wrote the book that I always wanted to write and did it better
than I ever could!

Enjoy, and may you all have investment success!

It is true that the market is brutal to most of the people who

challenge it. But so is Mount Everest, and that shouldn’t—and

doesn’t—stop people from trying to reach the top. What is expected

of a mountain or a market is only that it have no favorites—that it

treat all challengers as equals. . . . Trading can be an intellectual

stimulation, as well as a way to make money. Played well, it

demands skills of the highest order, and skills the trader must work

very hard to acquire. A well-conceived and executed transaction is

a thing of beauty, to be experienced, enjoyed, and remembered. It

should have an essence transcending monetary reward. A piece of

each trade should stay with you, forever, because the memory is

important. This applies equally to unsuccessful trades, of which

there will be many. Even getting out of a bad position, expeditiously,

should provide satisfaction not irritation.

An Introduction

Worth Reading

Champions aren’t made in the gyms. Champions are made from

something deep inside them—a desire, a dream, a vision.

—Muhammad Ali, three-time world

heavyweight boxing champion

I n the heat of competition, champions rise to their strengths,

triumphing over mere contenders. Marathon runners win through
superior endurance and a keen sense of pacing. The great ﬂying aces of
World War I defeated their enemies, winning dogﬁghts by thinking faster
and better in three-dimensional space. At the chessboard, victory goes to the
player who sees more clearly through the maze of possible moves to unlock
the winning combination. Virtually every human contest is dominated by
the few who possess the unique traits and skills required in their ﬁelds. The
stock market is no different.

Investing styles may differ among successful market players, but with-
out exception, winning stock traders share certain key traits required for
success. Fall short in those qualities and you will surely part ways with your
money. The good news is that you don’t have to be born with them. Along
with learning effective trading tactics, you can develop the mindset and
emotional discipline needed to win big in the stock market. Two things are
required: a desire to succeed and a winning strategy. In Trade Like a Stock
Market Wizard: How to Achieve Superperformance in Stocks in Any Market, I

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

will show you how my winning strategy brought me success and how it can
do the same thing for you.

I’ve been trading and investing in the stock market for most of my adult
life: 30 years and counting as of the writing of this book. Stock trading is how
I made my living and ultimately my fortune. Starting with only a few thou-
sand dollars, I was able to parlay my winnings to become a multimillionaire
by age 34. Even if I had not become rich from trading stocks, I would still
be doing it today. For me, trading isn’t a sport or just a way to make money;
trading is my life.

I didn’t start out successful. In the beginning, I made the same mistakes
every new investor makes. However, through years of study and practice, I
gradually acquired the necessary know-how to achieve the type of perfor-
mance you generally only read about. I’m talking about superperformance.
There’s a big difference between making a decent return in the stock mar-
ket and achieving superperformance, and that difference can be life-chang-
ing. Whether you’re an accountant, a schoolteacher, a doctor, a lawyer, a
plumber, or even broke and unemployed as I was when I started, believe me
you can attain superperformance.

Success  requires  opportunity.  The  stock  market  provides  incredible
opportunity on a daily basis. New companies are constantly emerging as mar-
ket leaders in every ﬁeld from high-tech medical equipment to retail stores
and restaurants right in your own neighborhood. To spot them and take
advantage of their success you must have the know-how and the discipline to
apply the proper investment techniques. In the following pages, I’m going to
tell you how to develop the expertise to ﬁnd your next superperformer.

Follow Your Dreams and Believe in Yourself

Impossible is just a big word thrown around by small men who ﬁnd

it easier to live in the world they’ve been given than to explore the

power they have to change it.

—Laila Ali

Dedication and a desire to succeed are deﬁnitely requirements to achieve
superperformance in stocks. What is not required is conventional wisdom

C H A P T E R   1   A N   I N T R O D U C T I O N   W O R T H   R E A D I N G

or a college education. My real-world education began when I was an ado-
lescent. I dropped out of school in the eighth grade at age 15, which means
that I am almost completely self-educated. Yes, you read that correctly. I left
school at age 15. I have never seen the inside of a high school as a student,
let alone attended a university. What I did have, however, was a thirst for
knowledge and a burning desire to succeed, to be the best trader I could
be. I became a fanatical student of the stock market, its history, and human
behavior. I started out by reading the ﬁnancial news and stock reports at the
local library. Over the years, I’ve read an incredible number of investment
books, including more than 1,000 titles in my personal library alone.

In light of my lack of starting resources and formal education, the level
of success I have achieved strikes some people as unlikely or even impossible.
Along the way, some have even tried to discourage me. You too probably will
face people who will try to dissuade you from trying. You will hear things
such as “It’s a rigged game,” “You’re gambling,” and “Stocks are too risky.”
Don’t let anyone convince you that you can’t do it. Those who think it’s not
possible to achieve superperformance in stocks say so only because they
never achieved it themselves, and so it’s hard for them to imagine. Ignore any
discouragement you may encounter and pay attention instead to the empow-
ering principles I am about to share with you. If you spend time studying
and applying them, you too can realize results that will amaze even the most
ambitious positive thinkers. Then the same people who said it couldn’t be
done will ask you the question they always ask me, “How did you do it?”

And the Trade Shall Set You Free

From the very beginning, I saw the stock market as the ultimate opportu-
nity for ﬁnancial reward. Trading also appealed to me because I liked the
idea of having the freedom to work at home and taking responsibility for my
own success. In my young adult years, I had tried several different business
ventures, and even though I felt enthusiastic, that burning passion was still
missing. Finally, I came to realize that what I was most passionate about was
freedom—freedom to do what I want, when I want, where I want.

One day it dawned on me: life is rich even if you’re not. I realized that
things were happening every day, good and bad, and that it was just a matter

4

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

of deciding what I wanted to be part of. People were getting rich in the stock
market. I said to myself, Why not be part of that? I ﬁgured that if I learned
how to invest in the market and trade successfully, I could achieve my dream
of ﬁnancial freedom and, more important, personal freedom. Besides, who
was going to hire a junior high school dropout? The stock market was the one
place I could see that had unlimited potential without prejudice. The author
and successful businessman Harvey Mackay said it perfectly, “Optimists are
right. So are pessimists. It’s up to you to choose which you will be.”

Achieving the Best of  Both Worlds

When I started trading in the early 1980s, I had only a few thousand dollars to
invest. I had to make huge returns on my relatively small account to survive
and still have some trading capital left. This forced me to hone my timing and
learn the necessary tactics for extracting consistent proﬁts out of the stock
market day in and day out. Like a pro poker player who grinds out a steady liv-
ing while consistently building a bankroll, I became a stock market “rounder.”
My philosophy and approach to trading is to be a conservative aggres-
sive opportunist. Although this may seem like a contradiction in terms, it is
not. It simply means that my style is to be aggressive in my pursuit of poten-
tial reward and at the same time be extremely risk-conscious. Although I
may invest or trade aggressively, my primary thought process begins with
“How much can I lose?” not just “How much can I gain?”

During my 30 years as a stock trader, I’ve discovered that a “risk-ﬁrst”
approach is what works best for me. It has allowed me not just to perform
or perform well but to achieve superperformance, averaging 220 percent
per year from 1994 to 2000 (a 33,500 percent compounded total return),
including a U.S. Investing Championship title in 1997. My approach also
proved invaluable when I needed it the most: cashing me out ahead of eight
bear markets, including two of the worst declines in U.S. stock market his-
tory. By adhering to a disciplined strategy, I was able to accomplish the most
important goal of all: to protect my trading account and keep the proﬁts I
made during the previous bull markets.

Invest in Yourself  First

When I began trading in the early 1980s, I endured a six-year period when
I didn’t make any money in stocks. In fact, I had a net loss. It wasn’t until
1989 that I began to achieve meaningful success. What kept me going?
Unconditional persistence. When you make an unshakable commitment
to a way of life, you put yourself way ahead of most others in the race for
success. Why? Because most people have a natural tendency to overestimate
what they can achieve in the short run and underestimate what they can
accomplish over the long haul. They think they’ve made a commitment, but
when they run into difﬁculty, they lose steam or quit.

Most people get interested in trading but few make a real commitment.
The difference between interest and commitment is the will not to give up.
When you truly commit to something, you have no alternative but suc-
cess. Getting interested will get you started, but commitment gets you to
the ﬁnish line. The ﬁrst and best investment you can make is an investment
in yourself, a commitment to do what it takes and to persist. Persistence is
more important than knowledge. You must persevere if you wish to succeed
in anything. Knowledge and skill can be acquired through study and prac-
tice, but nothing great comes to those who quit.

When Opportunity Meets Prepardness

When people hear my success story, the two questions they ask most often
are, How did you do it? and Did you just get lucky? The assumption is that I
must have taken a lot of big risks or been lucky along the way.

So how did I do it?
For years I worked on perfecting my trading skills, plugging away 70 to
80 hours a week, often staying up to pore over stock charts and company
ﬁnancials until the sun came up the next day. Even though the results weren’t
there yet, I persevered. I spent years separating the proverbial wheat from the
chaff, perfecting my process by analyzing my successes and, more impor-
tant, my failures. I invested countless hours in learning how great investors

6

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

approached the market and how they created and executed trading strate-
gies and developed the emotional discipline required to follow their models.
Then something wonderful happened. My preparation intersected with
opportunity. I had been honing my skills for years, and by 1990 I was fully
equipped to take advantage of a new emerging bull market. With all the les-
sons I had learned from my trial-and-error days in the 1980s, the pitch was
now coming across the plate, and I was staring at my chance to knock the
ball out of the park. I was 100 percent prepared, like an Olympic athlete who
has practiced and practiced and is now ready to perform with perfection.

Opportunities in the stock market can spring to life on short notice. To
take advantage of them you must be prepared and ready to act. Right now,
somewhere out in the world someone is tirelessly preparing for success.
If you fail to prepare, that somebody probably will make big money while
you only dream about what you could have been and should have done.
So prepare, prepare, prepare, because when opportunity knocks, which it
deﬁnitely will, you want to be there to answer the door.

Seize Permanent Knowledge

In the following pages, I will share with you a plethora of information as
well as speciﬁc tactics to help you succeed in stock trading, but there is no
substitute for real-life experience. Just as you cannot learn to ride a bicy-
cle from a book, the only way you can accumulate experience is by taking
action and producing results and then learning from those results, good
and bad. Unfortunately, experience cannot be force-fed; it must be acquired
personally over time. However, as you go through trials and tribulations
during your learning curve, keep in mind that once acquired, the skill of
proﬁcient stock trading can never be taken from you. No one can ﬁre you
from your craft the way a boss can from a job; it’s just you and the market.
All you have learned and the experience you have gained can bear fruit for
many years to come. Truly, this is what makes acquired knowledge and ﬁrst-
hand experience the greatest tool to succeed and build upon in stock trad-
ing and in life.

Put Passion at the Wheel

The best traders wake up every day excited about trading and speculation.
They can’t wait to get to work each day and ﬁnd their next superperformer.
They are challenged by the markets and feel the same passion and excite-
ment that drives athletes to greatness. Michael Jordan became the great-
est basketball player in history because he had passion for the game, not
because he was motivated by commercial endorsements. So it is with great
traders. They are motivated not just by money but above all by their passion
to become the best they can be.

Passion is not something you can learn; it comes from within you.
Passion transcends monetary reward. Don’t worry; if you are doing some-
thing you truly enjoy and you are great at it—whether you’re the best writer,
lawyer, archaeologist, or basketball player or the world’s foremost authority
on dung beetles—the money will come your way. For me, the greatest suc-
cess came when I ﬁnally decided to forget about the money and concen-
trate on being the best trader I could be. Then the money followed.

Those of you who enjoy investing and the art of speculation can learn
the  techniques  and  disciplines  needed  to  succeed  in  the  stock  market.
Concentrate on being the best you can be, and the money will follow. The
main thing is to let your passion drive you.

The Best Time to Begin

You don’t have to be great to get started, but you have to get started

to be great.

—Les Brown

Every day we have the opportunity to make choices and shape our future;
every day is the ﬁrst day of the rest of our lives. At some point, those days are
gone. You can choose to learn from or regret your failures and also rejoice
in your triumphs; however, the sooner you begin pursuing your dreams, the
sooner you can achieve them. If you truly want success trading stocks, take

8

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

action right away. You don’t need anyone’s permission or any reason other
than you’ve decided to stop wasting valuable time that you will never get
back. It all begins with beginning! You can dream, you can think positively,
you can plan and set goals, but unless you take action, nothing will materi-
alize. In his book Possibility Thinking, Robert Schuller said, “It’s better to do
something imperfectly than to do nothing ﬂawlessly.” An ounce of action is
worth pounds of theory. In the stock market, you can make excuses or you
can make money, but you can’t do both.

It’s not enough to have knowledge, a dream, or passion; it’s what you
do with what you know that counts. Even if you don’t become wealthy, by
doing what you’re passionate about, you will at least be happy. The best
chance you have to succeed in life is to do what you enjoy and give it every-
thing you’ve got. When you get up each morning and do what you love, you
never work a day in your life. Those days can begin today. The best time to
begin is right now!

A Time to Share

If you cannot—in the long run—tell everyone what you have been

doing, your doing has been worthless.

—Erwin Schrödinger

You may wonder why I chose to write this book now. More than a decade
ago, I was approached by several major publishers, but I decided not to pro-
ceed. Yes, authoring a book gives one credibility and prestige and maybe
even boosts one’s ego. Although the offers were tempting, I hesitated. I
thought to myself, Why should I give away all my hard work for a relatively
small sum of money, especially since most people probably won’t apply it
correctly? Admittedly, I was being a bit cynical. Then I realized that if even
one individual put forth the effort that I did in my earlier years, perhaps my
book could help that person achieve his or her dreams. Perhaps my work
could make a real difference for someone else; perhaps that someone is you.
Since my early twenties, I have been inspired by the words of Dr. Wayne
Dyer,  the  internationally  known  motivational  speaker  and  author.  Not

C H A P T E R   1   A N   I N T R O D U C T I O N   W O R T H   R E A D I N G

long ago, I reread his book 10 Secrets for Success and Inner Peace, in which
there is a chapter titled “Don’t Let the Music Die Inside You.” That chapter
really struck a chord with me. My father died relatively young, in his ﬁfties.
Later, my mother became sick and recently passed after a long battle with
an illness. This prompted me to think about my life. Over the years I have
accumulated a treasure chest of knowledge and expertise. I came to the real-
ization that it would be a waste to let it all just fade away. Books written by
great traders provided me with a foundation to build on—a passing of the
torch, one might say. Similarly, I would like others to beneﬁt from and fur-
ther advance my work.

The stock market provides the greatest opportunity on earth for ﬁnan-
cial reward. It also teaches great lessons to those who win and those who
lose, an education that goes well beyond trading and investing. Without a
doubt, the stock market gives you incredible exhilaration when you win and
deep humility when you lose. It is the greatest game on earth, and for me it
has proved to be the greatest business opportunity on earth.

To realize proﬁts from investing in stocks, you must make three correct
decisions: what to buy, when to buy, and when to sell. Not all of your deci-
sions will turn out to be correct, but they can be intelligent. My goal is to
assist you in making these decisions to the utmost of your ability so that you
will make quality choices. I have spent most of my life perfecting my stock
trading methodology, and now, in the following pages, I am going to share
these principles with you in detail. Armed with this valuable knowledge, I
trust you too will enjoy success in the stock market and pass the torch again.
Most of the examples in this book involve stocks that I traded for myself
between 1984 and 2012. This is road-tested research that is very near and
dear to me. I hope that you will gain useful insights from this hard-won
knowledge and that my story of success will inspire you to accomplish
superperformance in stocks and in life. If you’re willing to work and believe
in yourself, anything is possible.

What You Need

to Know First

There isn’t a person anywhere who isn’t capable of doing more than

he thinks he can.

—Henry Ford

M any people hope to achieve great success in the stock market,

but few actually do. Over time the average investor realizes only
mediocre or inconsistent results at best. The reason for this lack of success is
simply that most investors have not taken the time to study and understand
what really works in the stock market and what actually accounts for super-
performance. The vast majority of investors operate from faulty assump-
tions that are based on personal opinion or theory, not unbiased facts. Only
a fraction of stock traders have made the effort to carefully study the char-
acteristics and behavior patterns of superperformance stocks. Among those
who acquire the necessary knowledge, many fail to develop the emotional
discipline to execute a winning plan.

What is the underlying reason so many people fall short of achieving
their goals and fail to have big success in the stock market? Largely, it boils
down to the fact that few individuals truly believe they can achieve super-
performance in stocks. They’ve been told that a big return entails big risks or
that if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

Let me assure you that you can achieve superperformance in stocks if
you so desire and that it does not have to be a high-risk endeavor. It’s not
going to happen overnight, and you will most likely have to learn to do cer-
tain things that go against your natural instincts or perhaps relearn some
ingrained investment beliefs. However, with the right tools and the right
attitude, anyone can do it if he or she chooses.

No Luck Required

The more I practice, the luckier I get.

—Gary Player

Achieving superperformance in stocks is not a function of luck or even cir-
cumstance. Contrary to what many believe, it is not gambling either. As with
any great achievement, superperformance is attained through knowledge,
persistence, and skill, which is acquired over time through dedication and
hard work. Most of all, long-term success in the stock market comes from dis-
cipline, the ability to consistently execute a sound plan and refrain from self-
defeating behavior. If you have these traits, the odds are that you will succeed.
With gambling, in contrast, the odds are stacked against you. If you play
enough, you will deﬁnitely lose. If you think stock trading is gambling, I sup-
pose you could say the same thing about brain surgery (it certainly would
be a gamble if I were performing the operation). To a trained surgeon with
the necessary expertise, though, it is a job with risks that are offset by knowl-
edge, training, and ultimately skill. Stock trading is no different.

Success in the stock market has little to do with luck. On the contrary,

the more you work a sound plan, the luckier you will become.

You Can Start Small

A new idea is delicate. It can be killed by a sneer or a yawn; it can

be stabbed to death by a quip and worried to death by a frown on

the right man’s brow.

—Charles Brower

With every new endeavor that you try, you will encounter naysayers. There
are people out there who will tell you that you can’t do it. If you don’t have
much money, they will say you don’t have enough trading capital, so don’t
even bother trying. Nonsense! I’m here to tell you that you can get rich from
the stock market even if you start small. Unless you’ve been successful in
your professional life already, you may not have much money to devote to
trading, and if you’re a young person just starting out, it may seem impos-
sible to bankroll a trading operation. Don’t be discouraged. You can start out
small, just as I did.

A friend of mine ran into the naysayer syndrome not too long ago when
he wanted to learn how to trade. Since he is a close friend, I let him come
to my ofﬁce each day and sit next to me to gain some hands-on experience.
Trading his relatively small account, he started to understand how to make
consistent trades and manage his risk. After he got the hang of it, my friend
decided to trade on his own from his home. One day I heard that he had quit
trading. I was surprised because he’d gotten off to a pretty good start. When
I asked him why he gave up, he told me that another friend had told him he
that couldn’t do it because his trading capital was too small and that he was
wasting his time. Discouraged, my friend just gave up.

Michael Dell started by selling computers out of his college dorm. Then,
in 1984, he founded what became Dell Computer Corporation with only
$1,000. Dell went on to become the largest personal computer company in
the world. I started with just a few thousand dollars, and within just few
years it grew to more than $160,000. A year later it was at half a million. With
a decent bankroll at last, I was able to parlay my winnings into my personal
fortune. The rest is history.

I am certainly not the only one who has accomplished superperfor-
mance. David Ryan won three consecutive U.S. Investing Championships,
posting triple-digit returns every year. Reading about David in the mid-
1980s prompted me to embark on my own quest for superperformance and
go on to win the U.S. Investing Championship myself.

There are many of us out there who started small and ended up rich.
What we have in common is that we refused to let others convince us it
couldn’t be done. Remember, people who say something can’t be done never

14

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

did it themselves. Surround yourself with people who encourage you and
don’t let the naysayers knock you off track.

No! It’s Not Different This Time

During every bull and bear market for the last three decades I have heard the
words “It’s different this time.” Surely, during the 1920s, the legendary stock
trader Jesse Livermore heard these same words. In How to Trade in Stocks,
Livermore said, “All through time, people have basically acted and reacted
the same way in the market as a result of: greed, fear, ignorance, and hope.
Wall Street never changes, the pockets change, the stocks change, but Wall
Street never changes, because human nature never changes.”

Of course, there are technological advancements along the way, and
some styles work better than others during certain periods. However, stocks
today rise and fall for the same basic reasons as they did before: people drive
stock prices, and people are basically the same emotionally. Trading can get
very emotional, and emotions can easily lead investors to false conclusions.
On the basis of 30 years of personal experience and historical analysis of
every market cycle going back to the early 1900s, I can assure you that noth-
ing has changed very much. In fact, history repeats itself over and over.

Let the pundits clamor that it’s different this time. Meanwhile, new
leaders in the stock market emerge, hit the new high list, and amaze all the
so-called experts. Fortunes are made and lost time and time again for the
same timeless reasons. One thing you can count on is that history will repeat
itself. The only question is: How good a student are you?

Your Greatest Challenge Is Not the Market

The world is full of people looking for a secret formula for success.

They do not want to think on their own; they just want a recipe to

follow. They are attracted to the idea of strategy for that very reason.

—Robert Greene

success in the stock market is not a system or strategy; it’s within you, and
it will be realized only to the extent that you are able to control and direct
your emotions as you encounter challenges, of which I assure you there will
be many. You might as well know that at the start. Otherwise, you’ll only be
chasing false hopes.

If you want a decent return, you can always put your money with a good
mutual fund manager, in a hedge fund, or in an index fund. If you want super-
performance, you are going to have to go the extra mile. But ﬁrst you need to
understand that your greatest challenge is not the stock market. It’s you.

No One Is Going to Do It for You

My ﬁrst experience investing in the stock market was with a full-service
stockbroker in the early 1980s, and it wasn’t pleasant. In a few short months
my entire account was wiped out. Although this was painful and a major set-
back ﬁnancially, it turned out to be one of my most valuable lessons about
investing.

My broker at the time persuaded me to buy stock in a biotech com-
pany that supposedly had developed an AIDS cure. He said that he had a
really good indication from some important industry “pros” that U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) approval was coming and the stock would
rocket on the news. Being a novice to the market, I bought that line of BS. I
was blinded by the potential reward and did not even think about the risk.

Shortly after I purchased the stock, it sold off from $18 to around $12. I
was extremely concerned, but when I called the broker, he assured me that
this was “a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity” and that the stock was a “bar-
gain.” He recommended that I double up my position because that would
lower my average cost and give me even more proﬁt when the stock ﬁnally
took off. (Does this sound familiar?) Long story short: the stock kept sink-
ing, and eventually I lost all my money as I watched in horror while it fell to
less than $1. Of course the broker still got his commissions.

In hindsight, this broker did me a very big favor. It was precisely at that
point that I decided to do my own research and trading; I vowed I would
never again surrender my investment decisions to someone else. If you
aren’t prepared to invest a good portion of your time before you invest

16

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

your money, you’re just throwing darts. At some point, you will surely be
taken to the cleaners.

Have conﬁdence in your ability. Learn to do your own research and
think for yourself. Your own resources are far superior to outside research,
tips, and so-called expert opinions because they’re yours and therefore you
can keep tabs on them. No one cares about your money and your future as
much as you do. Do the work, own your failures, and you will own your suc-
cess. No one is going to make you rich except you.

Do You Want to Be Right or Make Money?

After my biotech ﬁasco with the full-service broker, I decided to take mat-
ters into my own hands. I opened a trading account at a discount house
where I met a broker named Ron. Over the course of a couple of years, Ron
and I became pretty close friends; we had certain things in common, but it
certainly wasn’t evident in our trading styles. He was sort of a value buyer
who wasn’t concerned about supply and demand or price trends. My style,
in contrast, was to buy new, relatively unknown companies on the rise. I
demanded that they be in a price uptrend, and if they went down much
below my purchase price, I would sell them. At least that was the plan.

As Ron and I watched each other’s trades, our favorite sport became
giving the other guy a hard time when one of his stocks tanked. Sometimes
I’d hit a few losers in row, and Ron would razz me: “Hey, genius, what hap-
pened? That one sure went down the toilet!” The verbal jabs really got to me.
Sometimes I held on to losing stocks because I couldn’t stand the thought of
the ridicule awaiting me when I phoned in a sell order to Ron.

A stock would fall 5 percent and then 10 percent, and I knew I should
sell. Then I’d think of Ron and hold on to that dog while it fell 15 percent
and then 20 percent. The bigger the loss was, the harder it became to call
Ron and place the sell order. Even if he didn’t say a word to me, I felt humili-
ated. Meanwhile, the stock continued to suck money out of my account like
a rupture in the hull of a ship.

Both opportunities and perils surface suddenly in the market. It takes
swift,  resolute  action  to  exploit  one  and  elude  the  other.  Nothing  can

C H A P T E R   2   W H A T   Y O U   N E E D   T O   K N O W   F I R S T

17

unravel a trader’s courage more than a huge loss in a stock trade. It wasn’t
until I suffered enough big losses that I made the decision that turned
my performance from mediocre to stellar: I decided it was time to make
money and stop stressing about my ego. I began selling off losing stocks
quickly, which meant taking small losses but preserving the lion’s share of
my hard-earned capital. Almost overnight, I regained a feeling of control.

That new approach also freed me to take an objective look at my perfor-
mance. In the past, I’d tried to forget about my losing stocks. Now I was ana-
lyzing my losers and learning from them. I saw my portfolio with fresh eyes
and ﬁnally began to understand that trading is not about picking highs and
lows or proving how smart you are; trading is about making money. If you
want to reap big gains in the market, make up your mind right now that you
are going to separate trading from your ego. It’s more important to make
money than it is to be right.

Practice Does Not Make Perfect

I know people who have managed money on Wall Street for decades yet
have only mediocre results to show for it. You would think that after all
those years of practice their performance would be stellar or at least would
improve over time. Not necessarily. Practice does not make perfect. In fact,
practice can make performance worse if you are practicing the wrong things.
When you repeat something over and over, your brain strengthens the
neural pathways that reinforce the action. The problem is that these path-
ways will be reinforced for incorrect actions as well as correct actions. Any
pattern of action repeated continuously will eventually become habit.
Therefore, practice does not make perfect; practice only makes habit-
ual. In other words, the fact that you’ve been doing something for a while
doesn’t mean you are guaranteed success. It could be that you’re just rein-
forcing bad habits. I subscribe to the advice of the legendary football coach
Vince Lombardi. As he said, “Practice does not make perfect. Only perfect
practice makes perfect.”

In the stock market, practicing wrong will bring you the occasional suc-
cess even if you’re using ﬂawed principles. After all, you could throw darts

18

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

at a list of stocks and hit a winner once in a while, but you will not generate
consistent returns and eventually you will lose. The reason most investors
practice incorrectly is that they refuse to objectively analyze their results to
discover where their approach is going wrong. They try to forget the losses
and keep doing what they’ve always done.

The proliferation of cheap brokerage commissions, Internet trading,
and web-based stock market data may have provided everyone with the
same technology, but it did not grant investors an equal ability to use those
resources. Just as picking up a ﬁve-iron doesn’t make you Tiger Woods,
opening a brokerage account and sitting in front of a computer screen
doesn’t make you Peter Lynch or Warren Buffett. That’s something you must
work for, and it takes time and practice. What’s important is that you learn
how to practice correctly.

Why I Don’t Like Paper Trading

Do the thing and you will have the power.

—Ralph Waldo Emerson

As new investors learn the ropes, often they engage in paper trading to prac-
tice before putting real money at risk. Although this sounds reasonable, I am
not a fan of paper trading, and I don’t recommend doing it any longer than
absolutely necessary until you have some money to invest. To me, paper
trading is the wrong type of practice. It’s like preparing for a professional
boxing match by only shadowboxing; you won’t know what it’s like to get
hit until you enter the ring with a real opponent. Paper trading does little
to prepare you for when you are trading for real and the market delivers a
real punch. Because you are not used to feeling the emotional as well as the
ﬁnancial pressure, it will be unlikely that you will make the same decisions
you did in your practice sessions. Although paper trading may help you
learn your way around the market, it can also create a false sense of security
and impede your performance and learning process.

The psychologist Henry L. Roediger III, who is the principal investiga-
tor for the department of psychology at Washington University in St. Louis,

C H A P T E R   2   W H A T   Y O U   N E E D   T O   K N O W   F I R S T

conducted an experiment in which students were divided into two groups
to study a natural history text. Group A studied the text for four sessions.
Group B studied only once but was tested on the subject three times. A week
later the two groups were tested, and group B scored 50 percent higher than
group A. This demonstrates the power of actually doing the thing you’re try-
ing to accomplish versus preparing for it in simulation.

If you’re just starting out, you should trade with real money as soon as
possible. If you’re a novice trader, a good way to gain experience is to trade
with an amount of money that is small enough to lose without changing
your life but large enough that losses are at least somewhat painful. Don’t
fool yourself into a false sense of reality. Get accustomed to trading for real
because that’s what you’re going to have to do to make real money.

Trading Is a Business

Many people have the misconception that stock trading is a mysterious
endeavor that is governed by a set of laws different from those for an ordi-
nary business. Trading stocks and running a business are virtually identical.
In fact, to be successful, you must trade just as if you were running a busi-
ness. As an investor, your merchandise is stocks. Your objective is to buy
shares that are in strong demand and sell them at a higher price. How much
of a proﬁt margin you make will depend a lot on the type of business (port-
folio) you are running. You may be like Walmart, which operates on very
small margins but does a tremendous amount of volume with high inventory
turnover. Or you may be like a boutique that offers unique and trendy mer-
chandise and earns higher margins but does much lower volume. You may
be making numerous trades for a small gain, but by sheer volume you turn in
an impressive return at the end of the year. Or you may be a long-term inves-
tor with select merchandise that also produces a solid return.

In the end, it all comes down to having your gains on average be larger
than your losses, nailing down a proﬁt, and repeating the process. This is
the basic objective of any business endeavor. Most investors treat trading as
a hobby because they have a full-time job doing something else. However,
if you treat trading like a business, it will pay you like a business. If you treat

20

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

trading like a hobby, it will pay you like a hobby, and hobbies don’t pay;
they cost you.

Don’t Invest Like a Fund Manager

The amateur investor has many built in advantages that could result

in outperforming the experts. Rule #1 is to stop listening to the

professionals.

—Peter Lynch

As a stock trader in search of superperformance, not only should you
not listen to most professionals, you should not invest the way they do. If
you’re going to invest like a fund manager, why not just give your money
to a fund manager? This will achieve essentially the same result without the
work. Better yet, why not just invest in stock market index funds, which
beat most fund managers? The fact is that to outpace their peers, most big
fund managers need to learn how to invest less like fund managers and
more like superperformance traders. Most big funds are doomed to medi-
ocrity by design. Individuals, however, have a big advantage over these
institutional investors.

Contrary to what many believe, a professional money manager has no
advantage over an individual investor. Many big institutions utilize ﬂawed
principles that are based on personal opinion, tradition, and ego as well as,
in many cases, pure ignorance. The biggest handicap facing virtually every
big fund manager is size. First and foremost, institutional investors need
liquidity to handle the large blocks of shares they must buy to add positions
that will have a meaningful impact on their portfolios. This forces big play-
ers to pick companies with relatively large amounts of shares outstanding.
This is the exact opposite of what we know to be a key factor for superper-
formance: a relatively small number of shares in the ﬂoat.

Big institutions have a difﬁcult time taking a position in a company
with a small number of shares outstanding. Even if they can, the real prob-
lem comes later, when it’s time to sell the stock in a falling market. When
forced to liquidate a large position, an institution risks precipitating a fur-

C H A P T E R   2   W H A T   Y O U   N E E D   T O   K N O W   F I R S T

21

ther plunge in the stock’s share price as a result of the fund’s large block sell-
ing activity. An individual investor, however, can move quickly and respond
in an instant during both entry and exit, taking advantage of the best high-
growth situations available early on and then stepping aside when necessary.
Another drawback is that many big fund managers can invest only in
shares from a committee-approved list. Managers meet with these commit-
tees to justify buy and sell decisions. A dreadful situation for a manager is
having to explain a position gone disastrously wrong in a small, presumably
risky situation even though the company showed great growth prospects. A
safer bet with better job security is for that manager to buy larger, seemingly
safe plays such as IBM and Apple. Then, if something goes wrong, the entire
market most likely is suffering, and the losses can be attributed to the overall
environment. At the very least, the manager’s reputation is insulated by the
fact that he or she bought “quality.” As the old Wall Street saying goes, “You
will never lose your job losing your clients’ money in IBM.”

Institutions generally need to stay invested in portfolios that are diversi-
ﬁed across many individual stocks and industries. This is primarily a result
of their need for liquidity and the belief that spreading risk over many names
will reduce the risk in any one name. The vast majority of funds must stay at
least partially invested even during dreadful market conditions. Moving to
the safety of cash is frowned on. Most mutual funds never raise more than
5 or 10 percent cash. Managers are always being compared to benchmarks
such as the S&P 500. If fund managers fall behind their benchmark averages
for any length of time, investors will jump ship, and the managers could lose
their jobs.

Individuals, in contrast, can react to surprises that create new price
trends almost instantly. There is no committee approval process and no
diversiﬁcation mandate. With today’s technology, most traders—profes-
sional and individual alike—have nearly identical tools at their disposal.
However, individual traders have a tremendous advantage over profession-
als mainly because they have greater liquidity and speed, enabling them to
be more concentrated in a small list of well-selected names at even lower
risk because an individual can utilize stop-loss protection with little or no
slippage. An individual, with a faster response time, can be more patient

22

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

and strike at only the most opportune moments, which is the best advan-
tage of all.

Most big institutions would rather make what they regard as safe invest-
ments than pursue big capital gains. They will boast about success if the
market is down 40 percent but their portfolio has lost only, say, 32 percent.
That’s an example of what they claim is beating the market! If you think for
a minute that the big institutional approach is safer or less risky, I suggest
you take a look at your favorite mutual funds and study their performance
during past major bear markets.

For a big fund manager, size impairs precision: the ability to enter and
exit stock positions without affecting price in a counterproductive way. This
technical disadvantage forces the manager to seek informational superior-
ity. Although tactics and techniques play a role for virtually every investor,
the individual can utilize a tactical approach with far greater efﬁciency and
effectiveness than can the large institutional player.

The bottom line is that if you want mutual fund–like results, invest like
a fund manager. If you want superperformance results, you must invest like
a superperformance investor.

Conventional Wisdom Produces
Conventional Results

A “sound” banker, alas! is not one who foresees danger, and avoids

it, but one who, when he is ruined, is ruined in a conventional and

orthodox way along with his fellows, so that no one can readily

blame him.

—John Maynard Keynes

Throughout this book you will read about ﬁndings and facts that debunk
many widely accepted notions about how to succeed in the stock market.
Many of these nostrums are taught by universities and ﬁll weighty text-
books. Some of them hold up as standard references on investing. This
should come as no surprise. Nothing in our society is more respectable
than conventional wisdom.

C H A P T E R   2   W H A T   Y O U   N E E D   T O   K N O W   F I R S T

23

In my experience, attaining superperformance in stocks comes from
doing things that are different from what is obvious or popular. This is
often misinterpreted as risky. Applying conventional wisdom produces
conventional returns, not superperformance. If success were as easy as act-
ing like everyone else, we could become rich by mimicking the crowd.

As you observe and analyze the market, be open-minded and willing to
do things that most people won’t do. Growth comes at the expense of com-
fort. Learn to venture outside your comfort zone and always question con-
ventional wisdom. If you wish to be exceptional, you must by deﬁnition be
unconventional.

The Unavoidable Cost of  Success

If you want to be the best, you have to do things that other people

are unwilling to do.

—Michael Phelps,

winner of 17 Olympic medals

Ask yourself, What are my goals? Even if you haven’t thought out a life plan,
probably a few aspirations come to mind right away. Now ask yourself, What
would I give up to achieve those goals? That’s another story, isn’t it? The
choice to sacriﬁce is difﬁcult, but it is one of the most important decisions
you will make in the pursuit of success. Sacriﬁce means prioritizing, which
could result in giving up certain activities to have the time to pursue trading.
Admittedly, this is a tough step to take, but no champion has a completely
balanced life when he or she is going for a gold medal. Champions are laser-
focused on their goal; they understand the power of a narrow focus. This
comes at a price; it’s called sacriﬁce.

To Define Is to Sacrifice

I fear not the man that has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear

the man that has practiced one kick 10,000 times.

—Bruce Lee

24

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

Because you are reading this book, I assume that one of your goals is to
become the best stock trader you can be or at least to improve your invest-
ment results. To have any chance of real success, you will have to make
some choices about how you are going to pursue that goal. Odds are that
you won’t be the best value trader, the best growth trader, the best day
trader, and the best long-term investor. If you try to do it all, you will most
likely end up a mediocre jack-of-all-trades. You can’t say that a trader is a
trader any more than you can say that a doctor is a doctor. Can a physician
be the best brain surgeon, the best heart surgeon, the best psychiatrist, the
best pediatrician, the best rheumatologist, and the best bone specialist? Of
course not.

Consequently, you will enjoy market cycles when your trading style out-
performs other styles, and you will also learn to accept periods less condu-
cive to your style. I doubt you will overcome these less favorable phases by
adopting a different style each time you run into difﬁculty. When it comes to
stock trading, I know no one who, for example, can successfully trade value
in one cycle and then switch to growth the next or be a long-term investor
one day and then a day trader to suit the market du jour. To become great at
anything, you must be focused and must specialize.

Trader or Investor?

The average trader spends the majority of his or her time vacillating between
two emotions: indecisiveness and regret. This stems from not clearly deﬁn-
ing one’s style. The only way to combat paralyzing emotions is to have a set
of rules that you operate from with clearly stated goals. You simply must
make a decision: Are you a trader or an investor? Some people have a per-
sonality best suited for trading, and some prefer a longer-term investment
approach. You will have to decide for yourself which is best for you. Keep in
mind that if you fail to deﬁne your trading, you will almost certainly experi-
ence inner conﬂict at key decision-making moments.

Indecisiveness

(cid:115)(cid:0) Should I buy?

C H A P T E R   2   W H A T   Y O U   N E E D   T O   K N O W   F I R S T

(cid:115)(cid:0) Should I sell?

(cid:115)(cid:0) Should I hold?

Regret

(cid:115)(cid:0)

(cid:115)(cid:0)

(cid:115)(cid:0)

I should have bought.

I should have sold.

I should have held.

If you are a short-term trader, recognize that selling a stock for a quick
proﬁt only to watch it go on to double in price is of no real concern to you.
You operate in a particular zone of a stock’s price continuum, and someone
else may operate in a totally different area of the curve. However, if you’re
a longer-term investor, there will be many times when you make a decent
short-term gain only to give it all back in the pursuit of a larger move. The
key is to focus on a particular style, which means sacriﬁcing other styles.
Once you deﬁne your style and objectives, it becomes much easier to stick
to a plan and attain success. In time, you will be rewarded for your sacriﬁce
with your own specialty.

Expect Some Rotten Days

Many of life’s failures are people who did not realize how close they

were to success when they gave up.

—Thomas Edison

The key to success is to become a successful thinker and then act on those
thoughts. That doesn’t mean that all your ideas and actions will always pro-
duce the desired results. At times you will feel that success is unattainable.
You may even feel like giving up. I know. I’ve been there. I went six con-
secutive years without making a penny while pursuing stock trading. Along
the way I had days when I felt so demoralized by my unsatisfactory results
that I almost threw in the towel and gave up. However, I knew the power of

26

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

persistence. Then, after more than a decade of trial and error, I was making
more money in a single week than I dreamed of making in a year. I experi-
enced what the English poet and playwright Robert Browning meant when
he wrote, “A minute’s success pays the failure of years.”

Remember, if you choose not to take risks, to play it safe, you will never
know what it feels like to accomplish your dreams. Go boldly after what you
want and expect some setbacks, some disappointments, and some rotten
days. Embrace them all as a valuable part of the process and learn to say,
“Thank you, teacher.” Be happy, feel appreciative, and celebrate when you
win. Don’t look back with regrets at failures. The past cannot be changed,
only learned from. Most important, never let rotten days make you give up.

Records Are Made to Be Broken

For many years, it was widely believed to be impossible for a human to run
a mile (1,609 meters) in under four minutes. In fact, for many years, the
thinking was that the four-minute mile was a physical barrier that no human
could break without causing signiﬁcant damage to the runner’s health.
Then on May 6, 1954, during a meet between the British AAA and Oxford
University, the English athlete Roger Bannister ran a mile in 3 minutes, 59.4
seconds. Suddenly, the impossible was possible. Fifty-six days after Bannister
broke through the four-minute barrier, the Australian champion runner
John Landy ran a mile in 3 minutes and 57.9 seconds in Finland. Within
three years, 16 other runners also cracked the four-minute mile. What hap-
pened to the physical barrier that had prevented humans from running a
mile in less than four minutes? Was there a sudden leap in human evolution?
No; the change in thinking made the difference.

Often the barriers we perceive exist only in our minds. Beliefs inﬂuence
what we attempt or choose not to attempt in life. In these pages, you will
learn powerful lessons and proven techniques that will make an enormous
difference in what you can attain with stock trading. Records are made to be

Specific Entry Point®

Analysis: The SEPA®

Strategy

W hen I began trading stocks in the early 1980s, my idea of

a strategy consisted of nothing more than impulse buying of low-
priced stocks that had been beaten up. When stocks were trading near their
historical lows, I ﬁgured they had to be bargains. I didn’t have much success
with that approach. In fact, the results were downright dreadful. It wasn’t long
before I realized that many of these stocks were low-priced for good reason
and in most cases were on their way to lower lows. I did, however, see many
stocks hit the 52-week-high list and then skyrocket even higher in price. The
question became, What differentiates the highﬂiers from the duds, and is there
a way to identify the big winners before they become big winners?

Over the next ﬁve years, 1983–1988, I embarked on a comprehensive
research process, reading every book I could get my hands on and devour-
ing the daily ﬁnancial news. I bought books when I could afford them. What
I couldn’t afford to buy and take home, I stood at the bookstore shelves
reading, taking notes with a pad and pencil. I would even go to the local uni-
versity libraries with a pocketful of change and photocopy entire books for
a penny a page and then staple them together. Looking back, it must have
been comical to see my collection of photocopied books held together by a
few staples and me sitting at a fold-out card table that I used as a desk in the

27

28

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

corner of mother’s dining room. No one in my family had a clue about what
I was doing with those makeshift books. It was a modest beginning, but in
the long run, it got the job done.

The Beginning of  a Turning Point

The knowledge I have amassed has come not only from three decades of
hands-on experience but also from the study of those who arrived before
me. Although I have taken the information in, reﬁned it, and retooled it into
my own Speciﬁc Entry Point Analysis, or SEPA, to suit my own trading, I am
indebted to the market masters whose groundbreaking works go back many
decades. An eye-opening book for me was Richard Love’s Superperformance
Stocks. Although much of the book was about the political cycle, I was
intrigued by Chapter 7, which focused on the commonalities of big win-
ning stocks. Love’s studies from 1962 to 1976 focused on the characteristics
of stocks that went up a minimum of 300 percent in a two-year period; he
called them superperformance stocks.

Although Love’s approach caught my attention, initially I wasn’t sure
exactly how to use it in my own trading, and so the information stayed
tucked away in my mind unused while I continued my quest to learn more.
In 1988, I read an article in the March–April issue of Financial Analyst
Journal titled “The Anatomy of a Stock Market Winner.” The article dis-
cussed the ﬁndings from a study of superior securities: stocks that went
up a minimum of 100 percent in a calendar year. The author, Marc R.
Reinganum, had explored the 222 stock market winners from 1970 to 1983
to determine what contributed to their superior performance.

As I read the article, the proverbial bell went off in my head and I
recalled Love’s book. For one thing, there was a partial overlap between the
time frames studied by Love and Reinganum. Furthermore, the purposes
of their studies were almost identical: focusing on stocks that had made the
biggest gains to identify the characteristics that accounted for their stellar
performance. Now all I needed was to get my hands on Love’s book again,
which was out of print and pretty rare. Luckily, a friend of mine found a
copy in Canada at a book fair for only a dollar, which he bought and mailed

C H A P T E R   3   S P E C I F I C   E N T R Y   P O I N T   A N A LY S I S

29

to me. With Love’s book and Reinganum’s results in hand, I compared the
ﬁndings of both studies and focused on the similarities between them. As
I cross-referenced the two, my conﬁdence increased that this approach
(known as reverse factor modeling) had merit and that there was a possibil-
ity I could use it in a methodical fashion to ﬁnd big stock winners. It made
intuitive sense to me: studying the best to ﬁnd the best.

Studying Love’s work set me on a course to learn what makes a stock
move up dramatically in price to join the elite circle of superperformers.
This ultimately became my life’s work. Love’s ﬁndings convinced me of
three empowering points:

1.  There is a right time and a wrong time to buy stocks.

2.  Stocks with superperformance potential are identiﬁable before

they increase dramatically in price.

3.  By correctly investing in these stocks, it is possible to build a small

amount of capital into a fortune in a relatively short period.

The Melting Pot

Over the course of my trading career, in addition to Richard Love’s book,
the works of others have inspired me. Among them was The Relative Strength
Concept of Common Stock Price Forecasting by Robert A. Levy, which helped
me banish the “buy weakness” mentality and was instrumental in my new
approach of focusing on strength. Then there was Edward S. Jensen’s Stock
Market Blueprints, published in 1967. Jensen’s book included his blueprints
for each type of stock, which were based on criteria such as income, growth,
cyclical growth, and dynamic growth. What I liked about Jensen was that he,
like Love, proceeded from an objective study of stocks to create templates
from factor models. This rigorous approach inspired me to create my own
Leadership Proﬁle®.

Another inﬂuence was Richard Donchian, who was born in Hartford,
Connecticut; graduated from Yale with a degree in economics; and went
to work on Wall Street in the 1930s. Donchian is considered the creator of

30

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

the managed futures industry. He developed a rule-based trading approach
that became known as trend following. Among his principles was the buying
and selling of stocks when the 5-period moving average crossed above and
below the 20-period moving average. It was Donchian’s work that inﬂu-
enced me to add certain trend elements to my model for qualifying trades
and timing entries.

Later I came across William L. Jiler, who did extensive work in chart pat-
terns. In his book, Jiler acknowledged the contribution of Donchian, who at
the time was director of commodity research at the securities ﬁrm Hayden
Stone. These men became my professors as I meticulously studied the mar-
ket. From Love, I learned historical precedent analysis and the common-
alities of superperformance stocks; from Jensen, blueprinting and proﬁling;
from Donchian, trend following; and from Jiler, chart patterns, including his
famous saucer with platform, which is now known as the cup-and-handle
pattern, popularized by William O’Neil, who also worked at Hayden Stone
in the 1960s.

Of  course,  the  master  of  them  all  was  Jesse  Livermore,  the  great-
est trader ever. In 1907, he made $3 million in a single day. While most
investors were devastated during the great crash of 1929, Livermore made
a whopping $100 million shorting the market. For me, this was incred-
ibly inspiring. Although most people associate Livermore with the book
Reminiscences of a Stock Operator, I gravitated to his pragmatic work How
to Trade in Stocks. Reading Livermore’s book crystallized my thoughts.
Many of the principles that were starting to work for me seemed no differ-
ent from those that had worked for Livermore back in the ﬁrst decades of
the twentieth century.

From one market professor to the next, the lessons were consistent and
clear. The basics of what made a superperformance stock in the past had not
changed appreciably. No matter how the economy evolved or which indus-
tries emerged, the basic criteria for superperformance were constant. Many
people before me had come to the same conclusion. Although the names dif-
fered and each had his or her own tactics for exploiting this phenomenon, a
collective body of knowledge existed and waited for new explorers to build
on that foundation.

At Last Technology

By the late 1980s I bought my ﬁrst “powerful” computer; by that I mean a
machine I could use for something other than playing Tennis Pong on a
monochrome green screen. In addition to putting real-time quotes right on
my desk, the computer allowed me to create a database and gave me access to
more information. Now I could conduct quantitative analysis: tracking and
studying more big winners and observing stocks in real time to conﬁrm his-
torical ﬁndings in a modern time frame. The computer also allowed me to
screen thousands of potential companies on the basis of superperformance
characteristics. Before this, I was ﬁnding and tracking stocks manually, which
as you might guess placed a severe limitation on how many I could cover. Early
on, I even created my stock charts by hand on graph paper daily. What a chore!
As I studied and traded stocks in real time, the data I collected and the
results I produced agreed with Love and Reinganum’s conclusions. Up to
this point, I had not developed a speciﬁc formula for trading, but I was hom-
ing in on the characteristics of superperformance stocks and  starting to have
some meaningful success by trading on those insights for my own account.

Putting the Findings to Work

The boom in technology, consumer retailing, and healthcare in the early
1990s transformed obscure companies into household names. Utilizing
what I had learned during the 1980s, I was able to catch some big movers as
stocks transitioned from the 1990 bear market into a new bull market. US
Surgical, Amgen, American Power Conversion, Ballard Medical Products,
US Healthcare, Surgical Care Afﬁliates, Medco Containment, Microsoft,
Home Depot, Dell Computer, International Game Technology, and Cisco
Systems were at that time relatively unknown names that displayed strong
fundamental and technical characteristics. Many investors missed these
great companies during their phenomenal growth phases because of their
relatively high price/earnings (P/E) ratios. In 1991, the 40 top-performing
stocks (starting at above $12 a share) began the year with an average P/E of
29, and by year end their P/E ratios had expanded to 83.

The Leadership Profile

By using almost three decades of actual trading and meticulous accumula-
tion of historical data from as far back as the late 1800s, I’ve constructed a
blueprint of the characteristics shared by superperformance stocks. I call
this a Leadership Proﬁle, which is an ongoing effort to identify in detail the
qualities and attributes of the most successful stocks of the past to determine
what makes a stock likely to dramatically outperform its peers in the future.
The focus is not just on the magnitude of a price move—how much a stock
goes up—but also on the time element of the equation: how fast it goes up
and what accounts for the rapid rise. In the stock market, timing is cru-
cial because time is money. When screening my database, I compare each
stock candidate to how well it ﬁts the optimal Leadership Proﬁle and rank
it accordingly. The result is a dramatic increase in the probability of ﬁnding
the next superperformer.

SEPA: A Strategy of  Precision

Honing my timing for entries and exits has been a major focus for me.
Over the years, my SEPA methodology evolved into a strategy that has been
referred to by some as trading with surgical precision. The SEPA approach,
which I will explain in detail, allows me to ﬁnd those elite candidates that
have the potential to become superperformers. The objective of SEPA is to
take all the pertinent information available and pinpoint the precise spot at
which to enter a high-probability trade in terms of risk versus reward. SEPA
combines corporate fundamentals with the technical behavior of a stock.
The underlying criteria of SEPA are derived from rigorous research, decades
of application in the real world, and observed facts, not personal opinions
or academic theories.

The Five Key Elements of  SEPA

The basic characteristics are broken down into ﬁve major categories, which
make up the key foundational building blocks of the SEPA methodology:

1.  Trend. Virtually every superperformance phase in big, winning
stocks occurred while the stock price was in a deﬁnite price

C H A P T E R   3   S P E C I F I C   E N T R Y   P O I N T   A N A LY S I S

33

uptrend. In almost every case, the trend was identiﬁable early in
the superperformance advance.

2.  Fundamentals. Most superperformance phases are driven by an
improvement in earnings, revenue, and margins. This typically
materializes before the start of the superperformance phase. In
most cases, earnings and sales are on the table and measurable
early on. During a stock’s superperformance phase, a material
improvement almost always occurs in the fundamental picture
with regard to sales, margins, and, ultimately, earnings.

3.  Catalyst. Every stock that makes a huge gain has a catalyst behind
it. The catalyst may not always be apparent upon a casual glance,
but a little detective work on the company’s story could tip you
off to a stock with superperformance potential. A new hot-selling
product that accounts for a meaningful portion of a company’s
sales may provide the spark to ignite a superperformance phase
in that company’s stock price. Approval by the FDA, a newly
awarded contract, or even a new CEO can bring life to a previously
dormant stock. In dealing with small, lesser-known names, it
often takes some event to attract attention to a stock. I like to see
something that gets investors excited. Examples would include
Apple (AAPL) reaching cult status with its Mac and “I” products,
Research in Motion (RIMM) with its BlackBerry (so habit-
forming for Internet and e-mail junkies that it’s been nicknamed
CrackBerry), and Google (GOOG), which became so synonymous
with Internet search engines that it made it into the dictionary
as a verb. Each situation may be somewhat different whether
the stock is a classic growth company, a turnaround situation, a
cyclical stock, or a biotech trading on the promise of a new drug.
Whatever the reason, behind all superperformance there is always
a catalyst driving institutional interest.

4.  Entry points. Most superperformance stocks give you at least one
opportunity and sometimes multiple opportunities to catch a
meteoric rise at a low-risk entry point. Timing the entry point is

34

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

critical. Time your entry incorrectly and you will be stopped out
unnecessarily or lose big if the stock turns around and you fail to
sell. Time the entry correctly during a bull market and you could
be at a proﬁt right away and on your way to a big gain.

5.  Exit points. Not all stocks that display superperformance

characteristics will result in gains. Many will not work out even
if you place your buys at the correct point. This is why you must
establish stop-loss points to force you out of losing positions
to protect your account. Conversely, at some point your stock
must be sold to realize a proﬁt. The end of what once was a
superperformance phase needs to be identiﬁed to keep what
you’ve made.

The SEPA ranking process can be summarized as follows:

1.  Stocks must ﬁrst meet my Trend Template (see Chapter 5) to be

considered a potential SEPA candidate.

2.  Stocks that meet the Trend Template are then screened through
a series of ﬁlters that are based on earnings, sales and margin
growth, relative strength, and price volatility. Approximately 95
percent of all stocks that qualify under the Trend Template fail to
pass through this screen.

3.  The remaining stocks are scrutinized for similarities to my

Leadership Proﬁle to determine whether they are in line with
speciﬁc fundamental and technical factors exhibited by historical
models of past superperformers. This stage removes most of the
remaining companies, leaving a much narrower list of investment
ideas for an even closer review and evaluation.

4.  The ﬁnal stage is a manual review. A narrowed list of candidates
is examined individually and scored according to a “relative
prioritizing” ranking process that takes into consideration the
following characteristics:

C H A P T E R   3   S P E C I F I C   E N T R Y   P O I N T   A N A LY S I S

35

(cid:115)(cid:0) Reported earnings and sales

(cid:115)(cid:0) Earnings and sales surprise history

(cid:115)(cid:0) Earnings per share (EPS) growth and acceleration

(cid:115)(cid:0) Revenue growth and acceleration

(cid:115)(cid:0) Company-issued guidance

(cid:115)(cid:0) Revisions of analysts’ earnings estimates

(cid:115)(cid:0) Proﬁt margins

(cid:115)(cid:0)

Industry and market position

(cid:115)(cid:0) Potential catalysts (new products and services or industry-

or company-speciﬁc developments)

(cid:115)(cid:0) Performance compared with other stocks in same sector

(cid:115)(cid:0) Price and trading volume analysis

(cid:115)(cid:0) Liquidity risk

The SEPA ranking process is focused on identifying the potential for the

following:

1.  Future earnings and sales surprises and positive estimate

revisions

2.  Institutional volume support (signiﬁcant buying demand)

3.  Rapid price appreciation based on a supply/demand imbalance

(lack of selling versus buying)

Probability Convergence

I developed SEPA to identify precisely the point at which I can place a trade
to have the lowest risk and the highest potential for reward. My goal is to

36

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

purchase a stock and be at a proﬁt immediately. To accomplish this, I take
into account all the relevant fundamental, technical, and market factors and
pinpoint the position at which there is a supportive convergence. I execute
a trade only at the point of alignment across the spectrum with regard to
company fundamentals, stock price, and volume activity as well as overall
market conditions. I want to see these factors converge like four cars arriv-
ing at the same time at a four-way intersection. The SEPA method stacks
supporting probabilities to produce that alignment.

Virtually every big winning stock exhibits very speciﬁc and measur-
able criteria before making its big moves. In their superperformance days,
these stocks have distinguishing characteristics—whether a new product, an
innovative service, or some kind of fundamental change—that enables the
company to make money at a superior or accelerated rate and in some cases
for an extended period. As a result, the shares of these companies experi-
ence signiﬁcant price appreciation by attracting institutional buying. You
don’t have to know everything about a company or the market; however,
you need to know the right things. By putting all these elements together—
fundamental,  technical,  qualitative,  and  market  tone—and  demanding
that stocks be able to cross multiple hurdles, you will be far more likely to
identify something exceptional. The collective value of these parameters is
greater than the sum of their parts.

Superperformance Traits

Over the years, I’ve concluded that most superperformance stocks have
common identiﬁable characteristics. In the majority of cases, decent earn-
ings were already on the table. In fact, the majority of superperformance
stocks already had periods of outperformance in terms of fundamentals
as well as technical action before they made their biggest gains. More than
90 percent of superperformance stocks began their phenomenal price
surges as the general market came out of a correction or bear market.
Interestingly, very few stocks had superperformance phases during a bear
market.

C H A P T E R   3   S P E C I F I C   E N T R Y   P O I N T   A N A LY S I S

37

Superperformers Are Youthful

Generally, a superperformance phase occurs when a stock is relatively young,
for example, during the ﬁrst 10 years after the initial public offering (IPO).
Many superperformers were private companies for many years before going
public, and when they ﬁnally did, they had a proven track record of earnings
and growth. Some superperformance companies already established suc-
cessful product lines and brands before coming public.

During the bear market correction of the early 1990s, I focused on
stocks that were holding up well and then moved into new high ground ﬁrst
off the market’s low. Most of the names I traded were relatively unknown
at the time. These stocks were propelled by characteristics such as big earn-
ings growth and strong product demand. One example was US Surgical,
which pioneered products such as the surgical staple and laparoscopic sur-
gery. Software, computer peripheral, and technology-related stocks also
performed well during that period, fueled by the boom in personal com-
puting. Most investors shy away from names they have never heard of. This
is exactly the opposite of what you should do if your goal is to ﬁnd big stock
market winners.

Size Matters

Most companies have their high-growth phase when they’re relatively
small  and  nimble. As  they  grow  older,  larger,  and  more  mature,  their
growth begins to slow, as does the rate at which their stock prices appre-
ciate. Superperformance stocks are often small-cap companies, although
occasionally a big-cap name could see a surge in price after a turnaround
or a period of depressed stock prices resulting from a bear market. Most of
the time, however, it is a small-cap or a mid-cap stock that hits a period of
accelerated growth, which in turn creates a superperformance price phase.
Investors interested in superperformance should keep a constant look-
out for small to medium-size companies in the growth stage of their life
cycle (accelerating earning and sales). On balance, the growth of earnings

38

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

and sales and, more important, the stock price is usually more rapid for a
small to medium-size company than for a larger, mature company. Large
companies usually have proven track records of execution. With smaller
companies it’s important in most cases to conﬁrm that they’re already
proﬁtable and have proved that their business model can be scaled and
duplicated.

Look for candidates with a relatively small total market capitaliza-
tion and amount of shares outstanding. All things being equal, a small-
cap company will have the potential to appreciate more than a large-cap,
based on the supply of stock available. It will take far less demand to move
the stock of a small company with a comparatively small share ﬂoat than
a large-cap candidate.

This realization can also help you develop realistic expectations about
the proﬁt side of the equation. Large-cap companies are not going to make
large-scale price advances the way a younger, smaller company will. There
are times when a big-cap stock will be depressed because of a bear market
or a temporary economic hardship, which may provide the opportunity to
buy a company such as Coca-Cola or American Express or Walmart at the
beginning of a decent price move as it recovers. Generally speaking, though,
if a large-cap company advances rapidly in a short period, I’m inclined to
take proﬁts on it more quickly than I would with a smaller, faster-growing
company that may have the potential to double or even triple in a number
of months.

Stock Screening

Since the 1980s, I have been using computer assisted screening as a way to
narrow down a tremendous amount of information—as many as 10,000
stocks daily—to produce a manageable list of candidates that meet some
minimum criteria to be studied further. Today, there are many screening
tools available for the investor. Here are a few suggestions on screening.

When  you  are  conducting  quantitative  analysis  (stock  screening),
keeping it simple will serve you better than using a complicated model. You

C H A P T E R   3   S P E C I F I C   E N T R Y   P O I N T   A N A LY S I S

39

must be careful not to put too much into each screen. Otherwise, you may
inadvertently eliminate good candidates that meet all your criteria except
for one. For example, let’s say you want to select stocks that exhibit a cer-
tain level of earnings, market cap, estimate revisions, and so forth, until
you have 12 lines of criteria. If a stock meets 11 but misses by a hair on the
twelfth, you will never see that stock. Remember, if you have 100 items in
your criteria, a stock needs to miss only 1 to be ﬁltered out even though the
other 99 are met.

A better approach is to run separate screens that are based on smaller
lists of compatible criteria, for example, one screen for relative price strength
and trend and a separate fundamental screen that is based on earnings and
sales. Often, as you run isolated screens, you will see some of the same names
recurring, whereas a few names will appear on only one list. Remember,
computers are great for weeding out noise and pointing your research in
the right direction; however, if you want consistent superperformance, you
will need to roll up your sleeves and do some old-fashioned manual analy-
sis. That’s the interesting part of trading, and that’s what makes it fun and
rewarding.

Make a Commitment to an Approach

You don’t need a PhD in math or physics to be successful in the stock mar-
ket, just the right knowledge, a good work ethic, and discipline. The SEPA
methodology was developed after decades of searching, testing, and going
back to the drawing board countless times to uncover what actually works.
It has been time-tested and proved effective in the real world with real
results. You, too, will go through your own trial-and-error period: win-
dow-shopping and trying various concepts and approaches to the stock
market, whether value, growth, fundamental, technical, or some combi-
nation. In the end, to succeed, you will need to settle on an approach that
makes sense to you. Most important, you must commit to perfecting and
reﬁning your understanding of that methodology and its execution. A
stock trading strategy is like a marriage; if you’re not faithful, you probably

40

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

won’t have a good outcome. It takes time and dedication, but your objec-
tive should be to become a specialist in your approach to the market.

Although strategy is important, it’s not as critical as knowledge and the
discipline to apply and adhere to your rules. A trader who really knows the
strengths and weaknesses of his or her strategy can do signiﬁcantly better
than someone who knows only a little about a superior strategy. Of course,
the ideal situation would be to know a lot about a great strategy. That should
be your ultimate goal.

Value Comes at a Price

It’s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair

company at a wonderful price.

—Warren Buffett

W hen you think of value in the traditional sense, bargains

immediately spring to mind: something once priced higher
now is priced lower. It seems logical. Growth stock investing, however, can
turn this deﬁnition on its head. In the stock market, what appears cheap
could actually be expensive and what looks expensive or too high may turn
out to be the next superperformance stock. The simple reality is that value
comes at a price.

The P/E Ratio: Overused and Misunderstood

Every day, armies of analysts and Wall Street pros churn out thousands
of opinions about stock values. This stock is overvalued; that one is a bar-
gain. What is the basis of many of these valuation calls? Often it’s the price/
earnings ratio (P/E), a stock’s price expressed as a multiple of the compa-
ny’s earnings. A great amount of incorrect information has been written
about the P/E ratio. Many investors rely too heavily on this popular formula
because of a misunderstanding or a lack of knowledge. Although it may
come as a surprise to you, historical analyses of superperformance stocks
suggest that by themselves P/E ratios rank among of the most useless sta-
tistics on Wall Street.

41

42

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

The standard P/E ratio reﬂects historical results and does not take into
account the most important element for stock price appreciation: the future.
Sure, it’s possible to use earnings estimates to calculate a forward-looking
P/E ratio, but if you do, you’re relying on estimates that are opinions and
often turn out to be wrong. If a company reports disappointing earnings
that fail to meet or beat the estimates, analysts will revise their earnings pro-
jections downward. As a result, the forward-looking denominator—the E in
P/E—will shrink, and assuming the P remains constant, the ratio will rise.
This is why it’s important to concentrate on companies that are reporting
strong earnings, which then trigger upward revisions in earnings estimates.
Strong earnings growth will make a stock a better value.

Bottom Fishers’ Bliss

Some analysts will recommend that you buy a stock that has had a severe
decline. The justiﬁcation may be that the P/E is at or near the low end of its
historical range. In many instances, however, such price adjustments antici-

Figure 4.1  American Intl Group (AIG) 1999–2000

C H A P T E R   4   V A L U E   C O M E S   A T   A   P R I C E

43

pate poor earnings reports. When quarterly results are ﬁnally released and
a company misses analysts’ estimates or reports a loss, the P/E moves back
up (in some cases it skyrockets), which may cause the stock price to adjust
downward even further. This was the case for Morgan Stanley (MS/NYSE)
in late 2007. The stock price fell and drove the P/E to a 10-year low. Morgan
later reported disappointing negative year-over-year earnings comparisons,
and the P/E ratio promptly soared to more than 120 times earnings. With
earnings deteriorating and the stock selling at a P/E of 120, the stock was
suddenly severely overvalued. The share price plunged even further to under
$7. The cause of Morgan Stanley’s decline was an industrywide ﬁnancial cri-
sis, and by 2008 the P/E ratios of Bank America, Citigroup, and AIG all hit
10-year lows, along with those of many others in the banking and ﬁnancial
sector. Within 12 months, all three stocks plunged more than 90 percent.

The Cheap Trap

Buying a cheap stock is like a trap hand in poker; it’s hard to get away from.
When you buy a stock solely because it’s cheap, it’s difﬁcult to sell if it moves
against you because then it’s even cheaper, which is the reason you bought it
in the ﬁrst place. The cheaper it gets, the more attractive it becomes based on
the “it’s cheap” rationale. This is the type of thinking that gets investors in
big trouble. Most investors look for bargains instead of looking for leaders,
and more often than not they get what they pay for.

Don’t Pass on High P/E Stocks

It is normal for growth stocks to fetch a premium to the market; this is espe-
cially true if a company is increasing its earnings rapidly. Shares of fast-growing
companies can trade at multiples of three or four times the overall market. In
fact, high growth leaders can command even higher premiums in times when
growth stocks are in favor relative to value stocks. Even during periods when
growth is not in favor, they can sell at a signiﬁcant premium to the market.

In many cases, stocks with superperformance potential will sell at what
appears to be an unreasonably high P/E ratio. This scares away many ama-

44

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

teur investors. When the growth rate of a company is extremely high, tradi-
tional valuation measures based on the P/E are of little help in determining
overvaluation. However, stocks with high P/E ratios should be studied and
considered as potential purchases, particularly if you ﬁnd that something
new and exciting is going on with the company and there’s a catalyst that
can lead to explosive earnings growth. It’s even better is if the company or its
business is misunderstood or underfollowed by analysts.

Internet providers were a great example. When Yahoo! was at the fore-
front of one of the greatest technological changes since the telephone, I was
asked in a television interview if I thought the Internet would survive. Can
you imagine the Internet failing to exist? Not today. But in the early to mid-
dle 1990s you might have had a different view, as many did. That period was
precisely when Internet technology stocks were making new 52-week highs
and trading at what appeared to be absurd valuations.

Most of the best growth stocks seldom trade at a low P/E ratio. In
fact, many of the biggest winning stocks in history traded at more than
30 or 40 times earnings before they experienced their largest advance. It
only makes sense that faster-growing companies sell at higher multiples
than slower-growing companies. If you avoid stocks just because the P/E or
share price seems too high, you will miss out on many of the biggest market
movers. The really exciting, fast-growing companies with big potential are
not going to be found in the bargain bin. You don’t ﬁnd top-notch mer-
chandise at the dollar store. As a matter of fact, the really great companies
are almost always going to appear expensive, and that’s precisely why most
investors miss out.

High Growth Baffles the Analysts

You might recall when Mark [Minervini] was here last in mid-

October [1998] he recommended Yahoo!, which is up 100 percent

since then. . . .

Wall Street has little idea what P/E ratio to put on companies growing at
huge rates. It’s extremely difﬁcult, if not impossible, to predict how long a
growth phase will last and what level of deceleration will occur over a par-
ticular time frame when one is dealing with a dynamic new leader or new
industry. Many superperformance stocks tend to move to extreme valua-
tions and leave analysts in awe as their prices continue to climb into the
stratosphere in spite of what appears to be a ridiculous valuation. Missing
out on these great companies is due to misunderstanding the way Wall Street
works and therefore concentrating on the wrong price drivers.

In June 1997, I bought shares of Yahoo! when the stock was trading
at 938 times earnings. Talk about a high P/E! Every institutional investor I
mentioned the stock to said, “No way—Ya-WHO?” The company was vir-
tually unknown at the time, but Yahoo! was leading a new technological
revolution: the Internet. The potential for what was then a new industry
was widely misunderstood at the time. Yahoo! shares advanced an amazing
7,800 percent in just 29 months, and the P/E expanded to more than 1,700
times earnings. Even if you got only a piece of that advance, you could have
made a boatload.

What’s High? What’s Low?

Jan. 9 Minervini bought Taser (TASR/Nasdaq), a company that

makes Taser guns—nonlethal weapons for police departments. He

spotted its potential using his proprietary methodology, “Speciﬁc

Entry Point Analysis” (SEPA). He then rode the stock up 121% in

only six weeks.

—BusinessWeek Online, May 10, 2004

Everybody knows the old adage “buy low and sell high.” It makes sense—
like going to a store to ﬁnd something on sale. However, buying low and
selling high has little to do with the current stock price. How high or low
the price is relative to where it was previously is not the determining factor
in whether a stock will go higher still. A stock trading at $60 can go to $260,
just as a stock trading at $2 can go to $1 or even to $0. Was Yahoo! too high
when it boasted a P/E ratio of 938? How about TASER (TASR/NASDAQ)
in January 2004, just before it advanced 300 percent in three months; was it

too high trading at a P/E ratio of more than 200 times earnings? Conversely,
AIG appeared to be a bargain when its P/E hit a 10-year low in early 2008;
the stock fell 99 percent before the year was ﬁnished.

There’s a Reason a Ferrari
Costs More Than a Hyundai

If you want to buy a high-performance car such as a Ferrari, you’re going to
pay a premium price. The same thing applies to high-performance stocks.
The top 100 best-performing small- and mid-cap stocks of 1996 and 1997
had an average P/E of 40. Their P/Es grew further to an average of 87 and
a median of 65. Relatively speaking, their initially “expensive” P/Es turned
out to be extremely cheap. These top stocks averaged a gain of 421 percent
from buy point to peak. The P/E of the S&P 500 ranged from 18 to 20 dur-
ing that period.

Value  investors  often  shy  away  from  stocks  with  high  price/earn-
ings multiples. They won’t touch a stock whose P/E is much higher than,
say, that of the S&P 500 index. Savvy growth players know that you often
have to pay more for the best goods in the market. Consider the example
of CKE Restaurants, which sported a relatively high P/E just before the
stock price took off. CKE Restaurants emerged into new high ground in
extremely fast trading on October 13, 1995. Right before its breakout, the
stock had a P/E of 55, or 2.9 times the S&P’s P/E of 18.9. The company had
scored triple-digit proﬁt growth in the two most recent quarters. Analysts
saw the operator of Carl’s Jr. burger shops increasing proﬁt by a whop-
ping 700 percent from year-ago levels in the upcoming quarter. The stock
climbed for 103 weeks. It ﬁnally peaked near $41 in October 1997 for a
412 percent gain. During its price advance, CKE averaged a spectacular
175 percent growth in earnings from 1995 to 1997. Its P/E fell to 47, or 1.8
times the P/E of the S&P.

Apollo Group (APOL)
Most of the time money in stocks is lost not because the P/E was too high
but because earnings did not grow at a high enough rate to sustain expecta-
tions; the growth potential of the company was misjudged. The ideal situ-
ation is to ﬁnd a company whose growth prospects warrant a high P/E: a
company that can deliver the goods—and the longer it can maintain strong
growth, the better.

Consider the example of Apollo Group. From mid-2001 through 2004,
the P/E ratio for Apollo was virtually unchanged despite a 200 percent rally
in the price of the stock. Why did the P/E remain at the same level as it
was several years earlier even though the stock price soared? Because earn-
ings kept pace with the stock’s price appreciation. If a company can deliver
strong earnings as fast as or even faster than its stock price appreciates, an
initial high valuation may prove to be very cheap. Apollo Group went pub-
lic in December 1994 with a market value of only $112 million. Apollo met
or beat Wall Street estimates for 45 consecutive quarters. As you can prob-
ably imagine, this led the company’s stock price to superperformance status.

percent. During the same period, the Nasdaq Composite Index was down

Crocs Mania
As the plastic clogs originally meant for gardeners and boaters became a
fashion rage, everybody started wearing Crocs,  and the popularity spilled
over into the stock. Crocs (CROX/NASDAQ) shares boasted a P/E of more
than 60 times earnings, before the price blasted higher. But fads come and
fads go, and perhaps the world is ﬁnding that when it comes to Crocs, the
shoe no longer ﬁts. The P/E ratio for Crocs contracted from April 2006 to
October 2007 as earnings grew faster than the stock’s price appreciation.
If you had bought Crocs when shares were trading at more than 60x earn-
ings—the most expensive P/E in its history—you could have reaped a return
of 700 percent on your money in only 20 months. If you had waited for the
stock to trade at a more reasonable valuation and bought when the stock
traded near its historical low P/E, you would have lost 99 percent of your
capital in less than a year. Regardless of one’s opinion, the market always has
the last word.

Value Doesn’t Move Stock Prices; People Do

Many people get confused: they think we are trading the actual

companies themselves, that the pieces of paper we are trading,

investing, owning, are some sort of redemptive right, a coupon that

will give you certain cents off, or an ownership right that will allow

you to have a chunk of the brick and mortar if not the cash in the

treasury of the joint; untrue. These are, in the end, simply pieces

of paper, to be bought, sold, or manipulated up and down by those

with more capital than others . . . the fundamentals of the company

play only a part in what moves the stock up or down.

—Jim Cramer

Contrary to what many believe, the stock market doesn’t trade on the basis
of objective, mathematical measures of “intrinsic value” such as P/E ratios
or a stock’s price-to-book ratio. If that were the case, slavish devotion to
computer models would consistently pump out winners and fund managers
would regularly beat the market averages. If analyzing balance sheets were
the Holy Grail for stock investing, accountants would be the world’s greatest
traders. Neither is the case. There is no magic formula or mechanistic model
that can reliably generate excess returns in perpetuity. Everything is relative,
subjective, and dynamic.

Valuation  methods  that  work  wonderfully  during  certain  market
conditions will fail miserably during others. Every stock carries a growth
assumption, which constantly changes. These assumptions are in large part
constructed and based on personal opinion. Stock prices move on the basis
of what people think. Whether it’s an opinion about a balance sheet, the
company’s assets, a hot new product, an exciting new industry, the P/E ratio,
the book value, future growth prospects, or whatever, ultimately it’s percep-
tion that motivates investors and creates price movement. Value doesn’t
move stock prices; people do by placing buy orders. Value is only part of
the equation. Ultimately, you need demand.

C H A P T E R   4   V A L U E   C O M E S   A T   A   P R I C E

53

Only the perception of value can inﬂuence people to buy, not the mere
reading of a valuation metric. Without a willing buyer, stocks of even the
highest-quality companies are worthless pieces of paper. The sooner you
realize this, the better off you will be as a speculator.

In Search of  Value

In 1987, Irises, a painting by Vincent van Gogh, sold for $49 million, a world
record for a work of art. The painting changed hands at a price more than
double what it had been expected to reach. The sale was also accomplished
in what may have been record time in light of the ﬁgures involved; the bid-
ding rose from a starting point of $15 million to reach the ﬁnal sale price in
less than two minutes.

Analysts and investors search continually for some intrinsic value that
differs from a stock’s current market price. Often that quest boils down to
relating a stock’s price to its earnings. Concluding that a stock is overval-
ued because it sells for 65 times earnings is like saying that a van Gogh
painting selling at $49 million at auction is overvalued because the paint
and canvas cost only 40 bucks. The price of a van Gogh has nothing to do
with its intrinsic value; the painting sells on the basis of its perceived value,
which is directly affected by the demand for a one-of-a-kind piece of art.

Wall  Street  commonly  uses  two  measures  for  valuing  stocks.  One
method involves comparing a stock’s P/E ratio with that of its respective
industry group or that of the overall market (S&P 500 Index, etc.). Often
this leads to mistaken conclusions that laggard stocks are a value and market
leaders are overpriced. More often than not, the market leader that appears
expensive actually turns out to be cheaper in the long run than the lower-
P/E, poorer-performing stocks in the group.

The other method is to compare a stock’s P/E with its own historical
range for a certain period. The argument goes that if the P/E is near the low
end of its range or below the P/E of its industry group or the market in gen-
eral, the stock must be cheap. The stock may look cheap, but the market may

54

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

be marking down the merchandize for a good reason; indeed, that discount
might presage wholesale write-offs.

If tomorrow the price of a stock you own fell 25 percent from your
purchase price, would you feel better knowing that the P/E had fallen
below its industry average? Of course not. You should be asking yourself:
Do the sellers know something I don’t? Stocks adjust to new circumstances
every day, yet many investors keep holding their declining shares because
they consider the stock to be a bargain. Some advisors will even tell you to
buy more shares, throwing good money after bad. Meanwhile, your stock
continues to get clobbered, and you keep losing money.

Some of the best value investors were down 60 percent or more in the
bear market that started in 2007. Their experience of buying and holding
“solid” companies, which had worked so well for so long, led to compla-
cent behavior that resulted in large losses. In 2008, the overall market suf-
fered heavy losses, with the Value Line (Geometric) Index ﬁnishing the year
down 48.7 percent. The Dow was down 34 percent for the year. However,
the worst-performing Value Line categories were low price to sales, down
66.9 percent; low price to book value, down 68.8 percent; and low P/E ratio,
down 70.9 percent. The bottom line: value investing does not protect you.

No Magic Number

As history has shown, there is no common denominator or appropriate level
when it comes to a P/E ratio and superperformance stocks. The P/E can start
out relatively low or high. My suggestion is to forget this metric and seek out
companies with the greatest potential for earnings growth. Most of the time,
a true market leader is a much better value than a laggard despite its higher
P/E multiple. Crossing a stock off your list because its P/E seems too high
will result in your missing out on what could be the next great stock market
winner.

The 25 top-performing stocks from 1995 to 2005 had an average P/E
ratio of 33x, ranging from a low of 8.6x to a high of 223x. The three best per-
formers in the group—American Eagle Outﬁtters, Penn National Gaming,

C H A P T E R   4   V A L U E   C O M E S   A T   A   P R I C E

55

Figure 4.9  CKE Restaurants (CKR) 1995–2000

and Celgene—sported P/E ratios of 29x, 11x, and 223x, respectively, before
they made their big price advances. All three saw their stock prices rise at
a 40 percent or better compounded annual growth rate over the 10-year
period. In early 1995, CKE Restaurants traded at a relatively high P/E ratio
before staging a massive rally and then at a relatively low P/E before experi-
encing a major decline.

Warning: The Superlow P/E

One of the worst trades I ever made was Bethlehem Steel trading at

2x earnings. I said “How low can it go?” It went to zero.

—Jim Cramer

Although I don’t concern myself too much with the P/E ratio in my search
for superperformance stocks, there is one situation that gets my attention.
As a rule of thumb, I’m very reluctant to buy shares of a company trading
at an excessively low P/E, especially if the stock is at or near a 52-week low
in price. A stock with an exceptionally low P/E ratio can turn out to be real

56

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

trouble. A stock trading at a multiple of three, four, or ﬁve times earnings or
at a number far below the prevailing industry multiple could have a funda-
mental problem. The future prospects of the company may be questionable;
earnings could be headed much lower. The company might even be headed
toward bankruptcy.

Remember, the market is a discounting mechanism that trades on the
future, not the past. Just as you can’t drive a car by looking only in the rear-
view mirror, you shouldn’t run a stock portfolio on backward-referencing
valuation metrics. I would rather own a stock that’s reporting strong earn-
ings trading at a relatively high P/E ratio than a stock showing signs of trou-
ble trading at a very low P/E.

P/E Deception

If you compare a stock’s share price with its P/E ratio, often you will see
that a depressed P/E coincides with a depressed stock price and vice versa.
The same could be said about an overbought/oversold technical indicator
such as the stochastic oscillator. On the surface, both of these popular met-
rics appear to have a degree of accuracy at turning points because the eye is
drawn to peaks and troughs. However, this 20/20 vision is usually a gift of
hindsight. In real time, the eye is not very good at ﬁltering out all the noise
and static between the upturns and downturns. In addition, what is mostly
ignored or misunderstood is the varying time frames spent in the direction
of the countertrend reading. For example, one stock can remain overvalued
for months whereas another stock can remain at a similar valuation for years
before a change in direction takes place.

Trying to buy oversold conditions and sell overbought conditions as
a trading strategy is risky business. Trading with disregard for a strong
directional trend will ultimately lead to buying into a precipitous decline.
Similarly, buying stocks simply because the P/E is relatively low and sell-
ing because the P/E seems too high produces poor results time and time
again. Although overbought and oversold conditions as well as high and
low P/Es can exist at turning points, stocks can also have extreme high
and low readings in a directional fashion just before major advances and

C H A P T E R   4   V A L U E   C O M E S   A T   A   P R I C E

57

declines. Major market declines always plunge to deeply oversold readings,
and roaring bull markets storm through early overbought conditions while
advancing much farther.

The Broken Leader Syndrome

A common afﬂiction among many investors, including some professionals,
is what I call the broken leader syndrome. Here’s how it works. Investors who
refused to buy a dynamic new leader when it was emerging—before it sky-
rocketed—become interested after that stock has topped and broken down
in price. Usually this occurs during a stage 4 decline. These people buy stocks
that were previously expensive, thinking they will go back up.

The broken leader syndrome affects investors who weren’t able to spot
stocks such as Yahoo!, Amazon, and Apollo Group before their biggest price
moves. They weren’t on board when one of these incredible stocks made a
huge run of several thousand percent. Then the stock gets slammed. Now
these investors think they’re on to something. With a former highﬂier well
off its peak, these latecomers to the party think the stock looks good and is
now a bargain.

They use all sorts of reasons, such as “it’s trading near the low end of its
historic range” and “it’s trading at only 20 times earnings and has a growth
rate of 40 percent.” Worse yet, they’ll say, “It’s down 70 percent. How low
can it go?”

With all their rationalizing, they ignore the supreme fundamental: the
market’s judgment. They stayed away when the stock was a market leader
(probably because it looked expensive), and now they fail to recognize a
broken leader. When a leader tops, more often than not the stock price is
discounting a future slowdown in growth, which makes it no bargain at all.

Sun Microsystems is a good example of a broken leader play. The stock
had an incredible price advance during the 1990s and then topped out in
late 2000. Investors who were waiting for this powerhouse to correct, or
“come in,” so that they could buy it may have been elated to see the stock
off 75 percent from its high in 2001. Unfortunately, the party was over, and
a year later Sun’s stock fell a further 80 percent. Eight years later, investors

58

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

Figure 4.10  Sun Microsystems 1994–2009

who bought the stock at the discounted 75 percent off price not only didn’t
make money, they actually lost 99 percent of their capital.

Here’s a common misperception when a stock has a precipitous drop.
A stock that falls from $100 to $25 has declined by 75 percent. Since a stock
can drop only 100 percent, the thinking is that the risk is only an additional
25 percent, right? Wrong! If you buy the stock at $25, you could lose another
75 percent if it falls to $6.26. And if you buy it at $6.26, you could lose yet
another 75 percent if it falls to $1.56. After all, your money in the stock is
always 100 percent.

P/E Ratio Is a Barometer of  Sentiment

By themselves, P/E ratios aren’t very helpful in determining the potential
direction of a stock’s price. The P/E ratio tells you what the market is will-
ing to pay for a company’s earnings at the current time. Think of the P/E as a
barometer that measures the level of expectation. This is why many growth
stocks experience P/E expansion during the growth phase; expectations keep
getting higher as the company’s performance expands.

C H A P T E R   4   V A L U E   C O M E S   A T   A   P R I C E

59

Of course, there comes a time when the stock’s prospects darken and
business conditions change. The company may then be considered over-
valued. At that point, perceptions change and the stock price will adjust to
reﬂect the new set of circumstances. I use the P/E ratio as a sentiment gauge
that gives me some perspective about investor expectation. Generally
speaking, a high P/E means there are high expectations and a low P/E
means there are lower expectations.

Seek out companies with the greatest potential for earnings growth.
Companies growing revenues at a rapid pace are your best choice. Look for
new emerging trends that can translate into mass expansion: trends that are
scalable. Concentrate on entrepreneurially managed companies with excit-
ing things going on (a catalyst), and you’ll eventually latch on to some big
winners. The current P/E ratio at which a company trades is only a minor
consideration compared with the potential for earnings growth. Growth
stocks are driven by growth.

The PEG Ratio

The price/earnings to growth (PEG) ratio is calculated by dividing the P/E
multiple by a company’s projected earnings per share growth rate over the
next year. For example, if a stock is trading at 20 times earnings and has a
growth rate of 40 percent, the PEG ratio will be 0.5 (20 (cid:2) 40). The company
is trading at half its growth rate.

The theory is that if the resulting value is less than 1, the stock may be
undervalued; if the PEG ratio is over 1, the stock may be overvalued. The far-
ther the value is from 1, the stronger the signal is. In general, if a company’s
earnings growth rate matches or exceeds its P/E multiple, investors using the
PEG ratio for valuation may consider the stock fairly valued or even under-
valued. If the P/E multiple signiﬁcantly exceeds its growth rate, however,
the stock will be considered risky and overvalued according to this school
of thought. Many analysts intent on buying growth at a reasonable price
(GARP) use PEG ratios in various forms.

The point at which a stock is deemed undervalued or overvalued can
vary, depending on the analyst. Some investors look to pare their holdings
in a stock as soon as its price multiple exceeds its growth rate by any margin.

60

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

Like its P/E cousin, the PEG ratio can exclude some of the most dynamic
and proﬁtable companies from a candidate buy list. The PEG ratio is lim-
iting on the two sides of the equation that are most valuable: when a stock
has an exceptionally high or low P/E. Should a stock with a growth rate of
2 percent trade at two times earnings? Probably not. However, valuing a high-
technology stock such as Yahoo!, which traded at 938 times earnings, was
nearly impossible using traditional valuation measures. Another drawback
of the PEG ratio as I see it is that many of the broken leader plays are attrac-
tive with this method. This can entice you to buy into a stock that has put in
a major top and headed for negative surprises.

Gauging P/E Expansion

Because P/E is a ratio, its value will be affected if either the numerator or the
denominator changes. For example, the P/E will expand if a stock’s price
(numerator) rises faster than the company’s earnings (denominator). Both
numbers, however, can be moving targets, particularly when a company has
good potential for increasing its earnings and also is attracting buyers who
are accumulating the stock, which pushes the price higher.

To illustrate, let’s say Company A is trading at 25 times its earnings for
a P/E of 25. If it reports earnings that are 20 percent higher and the stock
price remains essentially unchanged, the P/E will drop to 20.83 times earn-
ings. If the stock price jumps 20 percent on the earnings news, the P/E will
remain the same at 25 times earnings. Over time, as a stock grows more and
more popular and the price rises consistently, its P/E ratio can expand as the
stock’s price appreciates at a faster rate than its earnings growth. If the stock
rises signiﬁcantly over 12 to 24 months and the P/E expands by 100 to 200
percent, doubling or tripling from where it started near the beginning or
from the bottom of the major price move, it’s possible that the price move is
in its later stage and is getting too widely recognized.

Historical study of superperformance stocks shows that the average P/E
increased between 100 and 200 percent on average (or two to three times)
from the beginning until the end of major price moves. This information
can be used in two ways. First, you can get an idea of a stock’s potential. You

C H A P T E R   4   V A L U E   C O M E S   A T   A   P R I C E

61

can estimate what it might sell for as an average best-case scenario within a
year or two down the road from your initial purchase price, that is, if you’re
buying a dynamic leader in a bull market. You could estimate future earn-
ings and apply the expanded P/E number to get a rough idea of the stock’s
theoretical potential.

Second, you can gain some perspective on how much of the company’s
good fortune has already been discounted by gauging how much P/E expan-
sion has taken place already. Let’s say you buy a stock with a P/E of 20 at its
initial breakout from a sound base. Multiply 20 by 2 to 3 to see what the ratio
could rise to. That gives you 40 to 60. You hope that the stock continues to
rally. Though it’s always prudent to look for sell signals, pay extra attention
once the P/E nears 2 and especially around 2.5 to 3 or greater. It could top soon
afterward. If this occurs, look for signs of decelerating growth and signs of
weakness in the stock price as your signal to reduce your position or sell it out.
In  the  1990s,  as  Home  Depot  stock  became  an  institutional  favor-
ite, rampant enthusiasm ran the stock price up well ahead of its earnings
growth. Home Depot’s P/E expanded from the mid-20s to 70x earnings in
just two years after the stock bottomed from its 1990 bear market low. A
period of sideways consolidation took place for the next four years while the

Figure 4.11  Home Depot (HD) 1988–2008

62

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

earnings played catch-up with the stock price. Then, in 2000, Home Depot’s
P/E ratio expanded by from 25x in 1997 to 75x. The stock topped shortly
afterward.

What Does All This Mean?

As we’ve seen, what constitutes a high or low P/E is far less clear—or impor-
tant—than you might have thought. What should you take away from this
discussion? Should you ignore stocks that trade at relatively low P/Es and
buy only those with high ratios? Not necessarily. The bigger point is that the
P/E ratio doesn’t have much predictive value for ﬁnding elite superperfor-
mance stocks. There is no magic number when it comes to the P/E. In fact,
the P/E is far less important than a company’s potential for earnings growth.
Stop worrying about the P/E ratio. If you have a company delivering
the goods as Apollo Group did, earning 40 percent per annum for four or
ﬁve consecutive years, whatever the initial P/E was is irrelevant; the P/E
takes care of itself. Leave the overintellectualizing and complex theories to
the professors and academicians and the valuation tactics to the Wall Street
analysts. An oceanographer may be able to explain all the complexities of
waves, tides, water currents, and undertows. When it comes to riding a wave,
however, I’ll put my money on a 13-year-old kid from Malibu, California,
who knows none of those facts but has surfed all his life and has an intui-
tive feel for the water. As a superperformance trader, you learn to spot and
ride trends to big proﬁts and learn to detect when once-advantageous trends
appear to be breaking down. Often, once the why becomes known, proﬁts
taken or losses incurred will already be a matter of history. Valuing a com-
pany on intrinsic value is not trading stocks; it’s buying assets. Your goal is to
make money consistently, not accumulate a lockbox of assets that you really
don’t own—just pieces of paper that were made for trade.

Trading with

the Trend

I don’t set trends. I just ﬁnd out what they are and exploit them.

—Dick Clark

M y  success  as  a  stock  trader relies on a combination of

science and art. Mechanical signals backed by scientiﬁc research
and intuitive feel are both important tools. In the stock market, few things
are purely black or white. To succeed, an astute stock trader must learn to
read between the lines and decipher and make decisions often on the basis
of incomplete information. There are, however, certain characteristics that
are not ambiguous or even open for interpretation. I call them nonnegotiable
criteria.

When I am screening for superperformance stocks, my initial ﬁlter is
rooted in strict qualifying criteria that are based purely on a stock’s technical
action and is designed to align my purchase with the prevailing primary trend.
Once this initial criterion is met, I run “overlay screens” and look at the com-
pany’s fundamentals to narrow the remaining universe of candidates. Simply
put, no matter how good a company looks fundamentally, certain techni-
cal standards must be met for it to qualify as a buy candidate. For example, I
will never go long a stock that is trading below its declining 200-day moving
average (assuming 200 days of trading exist). No matter how attractive the
earnings per share, revenue growth, cash ﬂow, or return on equity may be, I

63

64

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

won’t consider buying a stock that is in a long-term downtrend. Why? I want
to see some interest in the stock, preferably from big institutional investors.
I’m not interested in being the ﬁrst one to the party, but I do want to make
sure there’s a party going on. The goal is to eliminate stocks that are not worth
my time so that I can focus on contenders that have the best chance of being
the next superperformers. Buying stocks in long-term downtrends will sig-
niﬁcantly lower your odds of owning a big winner. However, if you want to
increase the odds, you should focus on stocks that are in a conﬁrmed uptrend.

Making Friends with the Trend

Newton’s ﬁrst law states that an object in motion continues in motion.
Things in motion possess inertia. An analogous property characterizes
the stock market: a trend in force tends to remain in force until something
occurs to change it. In other words, the trend is your friend. Although this
adage is familiar, some investors may not fully appreciate its wisdom. I
remember when I ﬁrst grasped this concept in a meaningful way.

In 1990, I attended an investment conference in New York City. On
the roster of market gurus and prognosticators were Ned Davis, founder of
the well-known institutional research ﬁrm Ned Davis Research, and Marty
Zweig, publisher of the popular market newsletter The Zweig Forecast; Marty
coined the phrase “the trend is your friend.” One of the speakers who caught
my attention not only for his colorful personality but also for his approach
to the stock market was Stan Weinstein, who at the time published the stock
market newsletter The Professional Tape Reader. Over lunch we had a chance
to chat, and as Stan explained his method, he left me with a core concept
that has stayed with me ever since.

Stan’s approach was based on a timeless principle of the four stages that
stocks go through, placing importance on knowing what stage a stock is in at
any speciﬁc time. The ideal scenario, as Stan saw it, was to buy stocks when
they are coming out of the ﬁrst stage and beginning to make a run higher,
which is the second stage. Then the objective is to sell them as they approach
the peak of the cycle, which is the beginning of the third stage. The fourth
stage, as you might guess, is a full-ﬂedged decline that you want to avoid or

C H A P T E R   5   T R A D I N G   W I T H   T H E   T R E N D

65

during which you go short. I had previously read about Stan’s approach in
his book Secrets for Proﬁting in Bull and Bear Markets (McGraw-Hill, 1988).
Although Stan wasn’t the only one to use this type of four-stage approach,
he was the ﬁrst I heard speak about it. I went on to adopt this concept as part
of my stock analysis.

Superperformance and Stage Analysis

Like all stocks, superperformance stocks go through stages. Over the course
of my trading career, I’ve taken a keen interest in studying the cyclical and
secular life cycles of stock prices. In particular, in examining the historical
price performance of the most powerful market leaders over many mar-
ket cycles, I could clearly see how they go through various stages. A stock
would trade sideways for a while and then move up rapidly. Eventually,
the rate of upward momentum would slow and become more erratic as the
stock was under distribution and topping out. After a top came the decline.
Sometimes, after the decline, the stock returned to a basing stage before
eventually making another run upward. The succession of one stage to the
next, through all four, could take several years. What I found through my
study of the biggest price performers was that virtually every superperfor-
mance stock made its big gain while in stage 2 of its price cycle.

As interesting as it was to study the stages of stocks’ price maturation
in hindsight, that didn’t help me determine in real time when stocks on my
radar were in the optimal stage 2 phase. Moreover, I asked, What created the
proﬁtable stage 2 advance? Hunting for a key to identifying the advent of
second stages, I plotted and overlaid the underlying fundamentals of super-
performance stocks to see how they correlated with price movement. My
objective was to see whether there was any cause and effect in the movement
from stage to stage and, if so, what it was.

Stock Price Maturation: The Four Stages

My studies of big market winners gave me an in-depth view of each of the
four stages of a stock’s life cycle: from dormancy into growth to peak and then

66

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

into decline. In addition to focusing on stock prices, I asked what was hap-
pening to trigger each of these phases. From a fundamental perspective, the
cause almost always was linked to earnings: from lackluster performance to
upside surprise and accelerating growth, eventually followed by decelerating
growth and then disappointment. These underlying fundamental changes
drove big institutional players into and out of stocks, phases that could read-
ily be identiﬁed by the huge volume spikes that occurred during both the
advancing stage and the subsequent decline. I identify these four stages on the
basis of what is happening with the stock in terms of price action:

1.  Stage 1—Neglect phase: consolidation

2.  Stage 2—Advancing phase: accumulation

3.  Stage 3—Topping phase: distribution

4.  Stage 4—Declining phase: capitulation

Stage 1—The Neglect Phase: Consolidation

Stage 1 is when nothing noteworthy is happening. The stock is in a period of
neglect; few big players are paying attention to the stock, or at the very least,
the market has not yet paid up for the company’s shares. During stage 1, a
company’s earnings, sales, and margins may be lackluster or erratic along
with its share price. There may also be an uncertain outlook for the company
or its industry. Nothing electrifying is happening to push the stock out of its
doldrums and attract the needed institutional volume support to move it
decisively into a stage 2 uptrend.

Stage 1 can last for an extended period, from months to years. Stage 1
can also be caused by a poor overall market environment. During a bear
market decline, even stocks with good fundamentals can mark time and do
nothing or even decline along with the overall market. You should avoid
buying during stage 1 no matter how tempting it may be; even if the
company’s fundamentals look appealing, wait and buy only in stage 2.
Remember Newton’s ﬁrst law, the law of inertia. An object in motion tends
to stay in motion, and one at rest continues at rest. If your stock is dead in

C H A P T E R   5   T R A D I N G   W I T H   T H E   T R E N D

67

the water, guess where it’s most likely to stay until something signiﬁcant
changes. You’re not going to achieve superperformance by sitting with dead
merchandise. To compound capital at a rapid rate and achieve superperfor-
mance, it is vital that you avoid stage 1 and learn to spot where momentum
is strong during stage 2.

Stage 1 Characteristics

(cid:115)(cid:0) During stage 1, the stock price will move in a sideways fashion
with a lack of any sustained price movement up or down.

(cid:115)(cid:0) The stock price will oscillate around its 200-day (or 40-week)

moving average. During that oscillation, it lacks any real trend,
upward or downward. This dead in the water phase can last for
months or even years.

(cid:115)(cid:0) Often, this basing stage takes place after the stock price has

declined during stage 4 for several months or more.

Figure 5.1  Amgen (AMGN) in stage 1: 1987–1989

68

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

(cid:115)(cid:0) Volume will generally contract and be relatively light compared

with the previous volume during the stage 4 decline.

No Bottom Picking Required
I can tell you from experience that attempting to bottom ﬁsh—trying to
buy a stock at or near its bottom—will prove to be a frustrating and fruit-
less endeavor. Even if you are fortunate enough to pick the exact bottom,
making signiﬁcant headway usually requires sitting without much progress
for months and in some cases years, because when you buy a stock near its
bottom, it is in stage 4 or stage 1 and therefore by deﬁnition lacks upside
momentum.

My goal is not to buy at the lowest or cheapest price but at the “right”
price, just as the stock is ready to move signiﬁcantly higher. Trying to pick
a bottom is unnecessary and a waste of time; it misses the whole point. To
achieve superperformance, you need to maximize the effects of compound-
ing; thus, it’s important to concentrate on stocks that move quickly after you
buy them. You want to focus on stocks that are already moving in the direc-
tion of your trade. To accomplish this, you should wait for a stage 2 uptrend
to develop before you invest.

Transition from Stage 1 to Stage 2
A stage 2 advance may begin with little or no warning; there are no major
announcements or news. One thing is certain, however: a proper stage 2 will
show signiﬁcant volume as the stock is in strong demand on big up days and
up weeks, and volume will be relatively light during pullbacks. There should
always be a previous rally with an escalation in price of at least 25 to 30 per-
cent off the 52-week low before you conclude that a stage 2 advance is under
way and consider buying.

In  the  following  figure,  note  that  the  200-day  moving  average  for
Amgen has turned up and is in a deﬁnite uptrend. The 150-day moving
average is above the 200-day moving average, and the stock is trading above
both the 150-day and 200-day moving average during the markup phase.
Note, too, the surging volume on the rallies, contrasted with lighter volume
on pullbacks. For Amgen, by the time stage 2 was clearly under way, the

C H A P T E R   5   T R A D I N G   W I T H   T H E   T R E N D

69

Figure 5.2a  Daily price bars of Amgen (AMGN) transitioning from stage 1

to stage 2: 1987–1989

stock price had already advanced more than 80 percent from its 52-week
low. This would be the point at which I would start to consider a new pur-
chase; any earlier lacks conﬁrmation and is premature, meaning you run the
risk of being stuck in dead money. Most amateurs would think the stock is
too high and wish they had bought it when it was lower, using hindsight as a
guide. That’s why most amateurs don’t make big money in stocks.

Transition Criteria

1.  The stock price is above both the 150-day and the 200-day moving

average.

2.  The 150-day moving average is above the 200-day.

3.  The 200-day moving average has turned up.

4.  A series of higher highs and higher lows has occurred.

stage 2: 1987–1989

5.  Large up weeks on volume spikes are contrasted by low-volume

pullbacks.

6.  There are more up weeks on volume than down weeks on volume.

Stage 2—The Advancing Phase: Accumulation

Although it may come without warning, a stage 2 advance can also be
ignited by surprise news such as a beneﬁcial regulatory change, a promising
business outlook, or a new CEO whose vision could improve the company’s
prospects. Or perhaps it’s a new company that suddenly attracts notice with
a big earnings surprise that beat estimates.

As the proverbial wind shifts and is now clearly at your back, the stage
2 advance signals the potential for clear sailing ahead. With a buildup in
earnings momentum (or in some instances earnings expectations), the stock
price starts to escalate because of a surge in demand for shares as big institu-

C H A P T E R   5   T R A D I N G   W I T H   T H E   T R E N D

71

tions buy the stock in size. A daily and weekly price and volume chart will
show big up bars representing abnormally large volume on rallies, con-
trasted with lower volume on price pullbacks. These signs of accumula-
tion should appear during every stage 2 advance.

By the time stage 2 is under way, the stock has been moving upward in a
stair-step pattern of higher highs and higher lows. The share price may have
doubled or even tripled at this point; however, this may be only the begin-
ning. The stock could still move substantially higher. If the company contin-
ues to deliver strong earnings, the growth rate will soon attract widespread
attention and subsequent buying, especially if the company has reported
several quarters of impressive earnings gains.

Stage 2 Characteristics

(cid:115)(cid:0) The stock price is above its 200-day (40-week) moving average.

(cid:115)(cid:0) The 200-day moving average itself is in an uptrend.

72

(cid:115)(cid:0) The 150-day (30-week) moving average is above the 200-day

(40-week) moving average.

(cid:115)(cid:0) The stock price is in a clear uptrend, deﬁned by higher highs and

higher lows in a staircase pattern.

(cid:115)(cid:0) Short-term moving averages are above long-term moving averages
(e.g., the 50-day moving average is above the 150-day moving
average).

(cid:115)(cid:0) Volume spikes on big up days and big up weeks are contrasted by

volume contractions during normal price pullbacks.

(cid:115)(cid:0) There are more up days and up weeks on above-average volume
than down days and down weeks on above-average volume.

Stage 3—The Topping Phase: Distribution

As the saying goes, all good things eventually come to an end. In the mar-
ket, stocks cannot keep up the momentum indeﬁnitely, churning out ever-
increasing percentages of earnings growth. At some point, earnings, though
still increasing, are going to rise by a smaller percentage. The stock price may
still be edging its way higher, although it may be experiencing more high vol-
ume pullbacks and increasing volatility.

During stage 3, the stock is no longer under extreme accumulation;
instead, it is changing hands from strong buyers to weaker ones. Smart
money that bought early when the stock emerged onto the scene is now tak-
ing proﬁts, selling into ﬁnal signs of price strength. As that occurs, buyers
on the other side of the transaction are weaker players who know about the
stock because it has made such a dramatic run and captured headlines. In
other words, the long trade in the stock has become crowded and too obvi-
ous. This distribution phase exhibits a topping pattern. Volatility increases
markedly, and the stock becomes visibly more erratic relative to its previous
stage 2 trading pattern.

Earnings estimates that have been continually ratcheted up on contin-
ued upside surprises will be too high to beat at some point. A company can-

C H A P T E R   5   T R A D I N G   W I T H   T H E   T R E N D

73

not keep beating estimates forever. At some point earnings per share (EPS)
momentum will start to slow. Either the stock price will anticipate that
change, trading lower than it did before the actual earnings event, or there
will be several quarters of slowing earnings growth (deceleration) and then
a breakdown in the stock price.

Stage 3 Characteristics

(cid:115)(cid:0) Volatility increases, with the stock moving back and forth in wider,
looser swings. Although the overall price pattern may look similar
to stage 2, with the stock moving higher, the price movement is
much more erratic.

(cid:115)(cid:0) There is usually a major price break in the stock on an increase in
volume. Often, it’s the largest one-day decline since the beginning
of the stage 2 advance. On a weekly chart, the stock may put in the

Figure 5.4  Amgen (AMGN) in stage 3: 1993

74

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

largest weekly decline since the beginning of the move. These price
breaks almost always occur on overwhelming volume.

(cid:115)(cid:0) The stock price may undercut its 200-day moving average. Price
volatility around the 200-day (40-week) moving average line is
common as many stocks in stage 3 bounce below and above the
200-day average several times while topping out.

(cid:115)(cid:0) The 200-day moving average will lose upside momentum, ﬂatten

out, and then roll over into a downtrend.

Stage 4—The Declining Phase: Capitulation

As the company starts to lose its EPS momentum and earnings slow down,
at some point there will be a negative surprise. The company will miss an
earnings estimate or preannounce earnings and guide Wall Street analysts
lower. For some stocks in certain industries, this may be foretold by invento-
ries, with a buildup of ﬁnished product or retail goods that reﬂects declining
demand or greater competition in the marketplace, which hurts the compa-
ny’s growth prospects. What was once an uptrend that then transitioned into
a topping phase has turned into a full-blown stage 4 downtrend.

During stage 4, earnings models are generally revised downward, which
puts more selling pressure on the stock. The stage 4 selling may continue for
an extended period until it’s ﬁnally exhausted, and the stock enters another
period of neglect. As a stock languishes, it’s back to stage 1. It may take a
while for the company to get back on the growth track and return to strong
earnings, or the company may remain in stage 1 for many years. In some
cases the company may go bankrupt.

Stage 4 is essentially the opposite of stage 2 in terms of price and volume
characteristics, with higher volume on down days and lower volume on up
days. You should deﬁnitely avoid buying while a stock is in stage 4.

Stage 4 Characteristics

(cid:115)(cid:0) The vast majority of the price action is below the 200-day (40-week)

moving average.

(cid:115)(cid:0) The 200-day moving average, which was ﬂat or turning downward

in stage 3, is now in a deﬁnite downtrend.

and lower highs, stair-stepping downward.

(cid:115)(cid:0) Short-term moving averages are below long-term moving

averages.

(cid:115)(cid:0) Volume spikes on big down days and big down weeks are

contrasted by low-volume rallies.

The Price Maturation Cycle

Now that we have broken down the four stages individually, it’s impor-
tant to understand that the study of the four stages of a stock’s life cycle
is not meant for pinpoint timing purposes, which requires a more precise
approach and tactics that I will discuss below. Rather, the four stages are
most useful for gaining perspective on where a stock is in its life cycle price-
wise and then to compare that with where the company is in its earnings
cycle. A stock can go through the cycle many times. By studying the four
stages, you will see clearly that you want to be involved in stage 2. I’m not at
all interested in getting in early when a stock is still in stage 1, and I deﬁnitely
don’t want to hang around for stage 3, let alone stage 4.

Figure 5.6  Amgen (AMGN) 1989–1997

Using Amgen as an example of a stock cycling through the various stages, you can

clearly see why you would want to be long during stage 2 and avoid the other stages.

How to Pinpoint Stage 2

As I’ve stated, history clearly shows that virtually every superperformance
stock was in a deﬁnite uptrend before experiencing its big advances. In fact,
99 percent of superperformance stocks traded above their 200-day moving
averages before their huge advance, and 96 percent traded above their 50-day
moving averages.

I apply the Trend Template criteria (see below) to every single stock I’m
considering. The Trend Template is a qualiﬁer. If a stock doesn’t meet the
Trend Template criteria, I don’t consider it. Even if the fundamentals are
compelling, the stock must be in a long-term uptrend—as deﬁned by the
Trend Template—for me to consider it as a candidate. Without identifying a
stock’s trend, investors are at risk of going long when a stock is in a danger-
ous downtrend, going short during an explosive uptrend, or tying up capital
in a stock lost in a sideways neglect phase. It’s important to point out that a
stock must meet all eight of the Trend Template criteria to be considered in
a conﬁrmed stage 2 uptrend.

Trend Template

1.   The current stock price is above both the 150-day (30-week) and the 200-day

(40-week) moving average price lines.

2.  The 150-day moving average is above the 200-day moving average.

3.   The 200-day moving average line is trending up for at least 1 month (preferably

4–5 months minimum in most cases).

4.   The 50-day (10-week) moving average is above both the 150-day and 200-day

moving averages.

5.  The current stock price is trading above the 50-day moving average.

6.   The current stock price is at least 30 percent above its 52-week low. (Many of
the best selections will be 100 percent, 300 percent, or greater above their
52-week low before they emerge from a solid consolidation period and mount
a large scale advance.)

7.   The current stock price is within at least 25 percent of its 52-week high (the

closer to a new high the better).

8.   The relative strength ranking (as reported in Investor’s Business Daily) is no

less than 70, and preferably in the 80s or 90s, which will generally be the case
with the better selections.

Riding the Tide; Timing the Waves

By using the Trend Template criteria, you will be able to immediately iden-
tify companies that are in a stage 2 uptrend; there will be no guesswork
involved. However, we are not buying a stock just because it happens to be in
a stage 2 uptrend. Therefore, it’s important to consider what happens within
the stage 2 acceleration. To illustrate, think of the upward movement during
stage 2 as high tide coming in. As you know, the tide doesn’t come in all at
once; it arrives on successive waves that take the water level steadily higher.
The overall direction of the trend is upward, but within it there are pulses, or
waves, of movement.

Within an overall long-term uptrend (the tide) there will be short- or
intermediate-term price action (the waves) that consist of pullbacks and
basing. These shorter-term moves may last from four or ﬁve weeks up to a
year or more in many cases. Most commonly, base patterns forming within
a stage 2 uptrend last anywhere from 5 to 26 weeks. During these basing
periods, the stock will basically go sideways for a while, as if it’s catching its
breath before making the next push higher. This sideways price is not to be
confused with a stage 1 phase. The stock is now in a stage 2 uptrend, stair-
stepping higher from base to base. This will continue all along the stage 2
advance.

Where Are We on This Mountain?
The Base Count

Switching metaphors, think of the movement of a stock’s price through the
four stages of its life cycle as the outline of a mountain, from the ﬂatlands to
the summit and back to the ﬂatlands again. As the mountain rises up the left
side (stage 2), there are areas where the path or ascent plateaus for a bit. This
is where mountain climbers would build a base camp, rest, and recharge,
getting ready for the next phase of the climb to the summit. That’s exactly
what happens with a stock. After a run upward, there is proﬁt taking, caus-
ing a temporary pullback, during which the stock builds a base. If the stock
is truly in the middle of something signiﬁcant, the longer-term trend will

C H A P T E R   5   T R A D I N G   W I T H   T H E   T R E N D

resume. The short-term pauses allow the stock to digest its previous run-up
so that it can move even higher as it emerges from a constructive consolida-
tion period.

At some point, the upward momentum ceases; the stock tires, and the
top is put in. This is like reaching the summit, and there is no more moun-
tain left to climb; now comes the descent. Generally, this occurs after three
to ﬁve bases have formed along the way in a stage 2 uptrend. The later-stage
bases coincide with the point at which the stock’s accumulation phase has
become too obvious, tapping out the last of the heavy institutional demand.
Bases 1 and 2 generally come off a market correction, which is the best
time for jumping on board a new trend. As the stock makes a series of bases
along the stage 2 uptrend, base 3 is a little more obvious but usually still
tradable. By the time a fourth or ﬁfth base occurs (if it gets that far), the
trend is becoming extremely obvious and is deﬁnitely in its late stages. By
this point, abrupt base failures occur more frequently. Some stocks, how-

ever, can turn up in a parabolic fashion and end in a climax run or blow-off
top. By itself, base counting will not tell you if a stock has topped or is about
to move substantially higher. It does, however, provide a great way to gain
perspective on where you are within the stage 2 advance. Combined with
speciﬁc price and volume analysis along with fundamental analysis, it can be
a very powerful tool. Base counting was introduced to me by Bill O’Neil and
David Ryan many years ago; it is a valuable way to ascertain where a stock is
within its price maturation cycle.

Trust but Verify

I never place much faith in my fundamental ideas about a particular com-
pany without conﬁrmation from the market, namely, the price of the stock.
The way I see it is simple: if a company’s management is so great and its
products are so great, the stock should at some point reﬂect those funda-
mentals. If strong fundamentals are not conﬁrmed by the stock’s price
action, the future may not be as bright as it appears. Or perhaps investor
perception of the company has not changed or has not materialized yet. You
want to get on board when institutional money is pouring into a stock and
lifting it signiﬁcantly higher. To do that, you need conﬁrmation that this
inﬂow is starting to happen before you invest.

Why is price action so important? Even if you’re correct in your fun-
damental analysis of the company, investor perception is what creates buy
orders, and you are going to need big buy orders in your stock to move it
up signiﬁcantly. Keep in mind that if the institutional investment commu-
nity doesn’t see what you see, your stock could sit dormant for an extended
period. Why sit and wait when you can put your money in another stock
that is already on the move higher and has attracted big institutional volume
support?

To compound your capital rapidly, you must be where the action is;
you can’t afford to have your money tied up in a stock waiting for what you
think is a great fundamental story to get noticed by the rest of the world. I’m
willing to give the ﬁrst leg up in a stock to someone else in exchange for con-
ﬁrmation that the trend is deﬁnitely in stage 2 with some momentum build-

84

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

ing. The goal is not to buy at the cheapest price but to sell your stock for
signiﬁcantly more than the price you paid in the shortest period. That’s
how superperformance is achieved.

Heed a Trend Reversal

At some point your stock will reach its highest price and top out. This can
occur with or without warning. Regardless of your fondness for or attach-
ment to a particular security, it’s important that you learn to detect and,
more important, respect a change in trend. Stocks very often top out while
earnings still look good. Investors who wait for the earnings picture to dim
before hitting the bid in the face of a stage 3 top or stage 4 decline often
end up with a huge loss or at the very least give back much if not all of

Figure 5.14  Netﬂix (NFLX) 2008–2012

what they made on the upside. When topping signs start to appear after
a long, extended price run, it’s time to take your proﬁt and head for the
exit. Companies will announce record earnings and try to create hype to
keep their stocks up. Carefully watch the stock’s price action for valuable
clues to which way institutional investors are leaning and, like a tree, bend
with them. If you are inﬂexible and ﬁght the powerful force of institutional
money ﬂow, you risk being snapped like a brittle twig.

Financial Stocks Warn of  Impending Trouble

The news media would have you believe that the troubles in ﬁnancials in
2008 came out of nowhere. The truth, however, is that the stock prices of
ﬁnancial companies were falling in a stage 4 decline for many months, warn-
ing of trouble ahead. All you had to do to avert a major disaster was heed
the stage 4 decline and sell. Even if you bought near the all-time high price,

Figure 5.15  Citigroup (C) 2004–2009

Warning signs were abundant in Citigroup (C) with a stage 4 decline under way in

late 2007 and early 2008, long before the worst of the ﬁnancial crisis hit.

stock. Even if you reduced your exposure gradually, you would have avoided the

carnage that came in 2008.

you could have taken a relatively small loss on many of the bank stocks
that ended up being a total disaster, that is, if you had paid attention to the
danger signs. For many of the ﬁnancial stocks, such as Citigroup and Bank
of America, there were clear-cut warnings. At the time, if you held those
names, you should have sold or at least reduced your position progressively
until you were in cash.

Trust Your Eyes, Not Your Ears

When a stock shows signs of topping or, even worse, enters a stage 4 decline,
you should trust what you see, not what you hear. Tune out the analyst and
discount company hype. The chart of Vicor shows that by the time the ﬂat
earnings were reported (which was a dramatic deceleration from the previ-

ous trend of triple-digit growth), the stock had already suffered a vicious
decline. This was the result of large institutional investors anticipating a loss
of earnings momentum going forward and exiting the stock in anticipation.
By the time a material change in earnings was reported, Vicor’s stock price
had already declined by almost 70 percent.

As you look at Crocs (next), note how the negative quarter (–71 per-
cent) was reported long after the stock topped and not until the price was
already down 73 percent from its high. This demonstrates clearly why you
cannot wait for a fundamental change when the price action of a stock turns
volatile or hostile into stage 3 or, even worse, stage 4. To be successful, you
must respect the trend and the wisdom of the market. Crocs’ weekly chart
shows the mass exit taking place as big institutions unwind positions as the
stock quickly transitions from stage 2 to stage 4.

Brokerage House Opinions

Should you buy a stock on the basis of a brokerage house’s recommendation?
If the stock is in a stage 4 downtrend, deﬁnitely not. Big brokerage houses
love to recommend stocks that are down in price. Often these upgrades are
based on valuation and completely ignore the fact that the stock price suf-
fered a major price break. Often, stocks that are upgraded on the basis of
valuation after a large price decline turn out to be good short candidates.
Learn to do your own analysis and base your purchases on sound criteria,
not because someone else says a broken stock is a good value.

We put CMG on our short alert list eight days before Citigroup raised

its rating to buy. Three months later the stock was down 40 percent.

A Material Change in Behavior
Is a Major Warning

Institutional investors can become wary of what had been a strong per-
former; they can suddenly send a stock plummeting as they get out. When
that happens, take heed. Before it becomes apparent that the fundamentals
have changed, a major break in the stock price often will occur on over-
whelming volume. If your stock experiences its largest daily and/or weekly
price decline since the beginning of the stage 2 advance, this is a sell signal in
most cases even if it comes on the heels of a seemingly great earnings report.
Don’t listen to the company or the media; listen to the stock. I have seen
companies report earnings that were only a few cents better than expected
on in-line revenues and skyrocket, and I have also seen companies report

Figure 5.21  Crocs (CROX) 2007

Crocs’ (CROX) stock price sold off an overwhelming volume after a “better than

expected” earnings report. This was just the beginning of what turned out to be a

99 percent decline in the stock price over the next 12 months.

earnings and sales much better than expected but the stocks sold off hard
and could not recover.

After the market close on October 31, 2007, Crocs reported quarterly
earnings per share of $0.66 versus a consensus of $0.63. Although this report
was 144 percent ahead of the previous year and even beat Street estimates, the
stock’s reaction was less than enthusiastic, falling 36 percent in just one day
on overwhelming volume after the earnings release. Notwithstanding a one-
day 5 percent dead cat bounce (a short-term recovery from a selloff that did
not resume the uptrend), the share price dropped another 29 percent over the
next six trading days. On November 13, 2008, Crocs stock traded as a penny
stock at $0.79 per share, down 99 percent off a high of $75 just a year earlier.

Many times before a fundamental problem is evident, there will be
a hint in the form of a material change in price behavior. That change
should always be respected even if you don’t see any reason for the sud-

huge volume.

den change in sentiment. Earnings may still look good. The story may still
be intact. However, in most cases, you’ll be far better off getting out—shoot-
ing ﬁrst and asking questions later—than waiting to learn the reason why.
When a stock that had been in a strong stage 2 suddenly goes into a stage
3 topping pattern or transitions quickly into stage 4, don’t sit there and
assume that everything is ﬁne. There is a reason for the adverse price move;
you just don’t know it yet. Whatever you do, don’t think that a big break in
the stock is now a buying opportunity. Many investors get caught in this
trap: A stock they own suddenly declines sharply. Believing that the market-
place must be wrong and that the stock is still a good performer, they decide
it’s time to buy more. They don’t realize that the stock price is down because
the big players know (or at least suspect) something is wrong and are getting
out. When you see that happen in the price action, regardless of what the
fundamentals are saying, it’s time to exit.

Let the Wind Fill Your Sails

As we’ve discussed in this chapter, to achieve superperformance, you need
the powerful force of institutional buyers on your side to propel your stock’s
price sharply higher. A proper stage 2 uptrend provides evidence that insti-
tutions are indeed stepping up to the plate, just as a stage 4 decline clearly
demonstrates the opposite. Having the long-term trend on your side is
like sailing with the wind at your back. If there’s no wind, you’re dead in
the water (stage 1), and if the wind is against you, you have little chance
of moving forward (stage 4). The proverbial wind in your sails is the long-
term trend of big money that’s buying in sync with you. You should look to
align yourself with this powerful force. Stick with stocks that are in a solid
uptrend and you will be much more likely to own a stock that has the poten-
tial to skyrocket and become a superperformer.

Categories, Industry

Groups, and Catalysts

W hen I’m considering a stock for purchase, the ﬁrst thing I

do is determine the type of situation I’m dealing with. In the
context of the nature of the business and the industry in which a company
operates, I want to develop an expectation of its prospective earnings growth
and ﬁnd out whether those prospects are widely recognized and therefore
discounted in the current stock price. Categorizing companies is a good way
to gain perspective and organize your thoughts about a particular stock. It
will help you establish the type of company you’re considering relative to
others in the market so that you can make a judgment about where the stock
is in its maturation cycle or curve. Companies don’t stay in the same part of
the curve forever, and some spend more time than others in certain phases
of the cycle; however, nearly all companies undergo a natural maturation.
Over the years I have analyzed tens of thousands of publicly traded compa-
nies. What I’ve discovered is that they generally tend to fall into one of six
categories:

1.  Market leaders

2.  Top competitors

3.  Institutional favorites

95

96

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

4.  Turnaround situations

5.  Cyclical stocks

6.  Past leaders and laggards

The Market Leader

My favorite type of stock to invest in—the area where I have made most of
my money trading—is the market leader. These companies are able to grow
their earnings the fastest. An industry’s strongest players are usually num-
ber one, two, or three in sales and earnings and are gaining market share.
Market leaders are easy to spot, but most investors have psychological dif-
ﬁculty deciding to buy them. The share prices of market leaders power up
the most percentagewise in the initial stages of a market rally. They move
into new high ground ﬁrst. That unbelievable price strength causes most
investors to think these stocks have run up too far; hence, most investors are
afraid to buy the very best stocks capable of superperformance.

What propels them even higher? Institutions that know enough about
a company and its future prospects provide the buying power. They are not
concerned about how far the stock has already advanced but about where
it’s going and what the prospects are for future growth. The best type of
growth situation is scalable growth: a company gaining market share in a
rapidly growing industry. The market for the company’s products or ser-
vices is extremely large in relation to the company’s size, and those products
and services are in high enough demand that the company can grow at a
high rate for an extended period. These companies have superior products
and services, and they are often part of a growing industry; although it is not
necessary that a market leader be in a fast-growing industry or sector, it is
certainly an additional plus if it is.

A  company  that  is  taking  market  share  in  a  slow-growth  industry
can also grow its earnings quite nicely. What’s most important is that the
company can make substantial proﬁts. A good balance sheet, expanding
margins, high return on equity, and reasonable debt are all signs of good
management. Some market leaders grow earnings at a very healthy rate for

  C H A P T E R   6   C A T E G O R I E S ,   I N D U S T R Y   G R O U P S ,   A N D   C A T A LY S T S

97

extended periods in industries with percentage growth rates in the low to
mid-single digits. However, a company that is taking market share or has
a large portion of market share in a fast-growing industry can increase its
earnings at a meteoric pace.

The main questions should be: What is the company’s competitive
advantage? and Is the business model scalable? Then it’s a matter of whether
management is executing successfully and delivering the goods, namely,
earnings.

Market leaders are capable of producing huge price appreciation during
their high-growth phase. They generally grow earnings at a rate of 20 per-
cent or higher. Many average 35 to 45 percent during their best 5- or 10-year
stretch. During their greatest growth period, some increase their earnings
at triple-digit rates. From March 1989 through May 1993, Cisco Systems
averaged over 100 percent quarterly earnings growth. Cisco’s stock price
advanced more than 13-fold in that period. During the early 1980s, when
Walmart was a little-known company trading as few as 20,000 shares a day,
earnings growth averaged 38 percent for 14 consecutive quarters. Walmart’s
stock price appreciated 1,000 percent in that period. Today, Walmart trades
more than 7 million shares a day on average.

When Expensive Is Actually Cheap
Market leaders in the high-growth stage are almost always going to appear
expensive. It only makes sense to value a rapidly growing company higher
than a slower-growing one. Here’s the beauty about ultrafast growers:
these companies grow so fast that Wall Street can’t value them very accu-
rately. This can leave a stock inefﬁciently priced, providing a big oppor-
tunity. As long as a company can sustain signiﬁcantly expanding sales and
earnings, the stock price will follow—maybe not immediately, but stock
prices do follow earnings growth over time. The faster a company can grow
earnings, the more likely it is that its stock price will follow.

Don’t be misled; there’s plenty of risk in high-growth companies. Wall
Street can punish a fast-growing company if earnings slow down even by the
smallest amount in relation to expectations. High-growth companies live and
die by earnings expectations. These companies have to constantly beat con-

98

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

sensus forecasts. As a company reports better than expected earnings, the bar
moves up for that company to beat them the next time. Eventually, the bar is
too high and the company misses. However, as long as the company can deliver
strong earnings and manage expectations well, the stock price can soar and
experience P/E multiple expansion. The goal is to identify and invest in market
leaders relatively early in the growth phase when proﬁts are accelerating.

The Category Killer
Every so often a company comes along and totally dominates a category;
the company has such a clear and sustainable competitive advantage that
other ﬁrms in the same market or niche ﬁnd it nearly impossible to com-
pete. These market leaders are known as category killers. A category killer is
a company whose brand and market position are so strong that it would
be difﬁcult to compete against it even if you had unlimited capital. A good
example is eBay, with an online auction site that gives it an overwhelming
advantage since buyers and sellers want to participate in the biggest mar-
ket with the most players. Therefore, they come to eBay, which gobbles up
the opportunity, leaving everybody else with the crumbs. Consider Apple,
which dominates its space, setting the prevailing trend with innovative tech-
nologies and truly unique products. Disney’s theme parks certainly rank as
a category killer with little formidable competition. So does a company such
as Walmart, which has taken a toll on the retail sector, in which many stores
ﬁnd it hard to compete against the giant.

The Cookie Cutter Concept
When a ﬁrm produces a successful formula in one store and then replicates
it over and over—in malls and in locations around the country or around
the world—it’s a cookie cutter. Think of McDonald’s, Walmart, Starbucks,
Taco  Bell,  The  Gap,  Home  Depot,  Starbucks,  Chili’s,  Cracker  Barrel,
The Limited, Dick’s Sporting Goods, Wendy’s, Outback Steakhouse, and
Costco Wholesale, which are great examples of successful rollouts of the
cookie cutter concept.

As you can see, many of the names that achieve success with the cookie
cutter business model are in the retail area. With this concept, when a com-

  C H A P T E R   6   C A T E G O R I E S ,   I N D U S T R Y   G R O U P S ,   A N D   C A T A LY S T S

99

pany expands into new markets, bringing on new stores rapidly (especially
if same-store sales are brisk as well), earnings can accelerate at a healthy
sustained pace. These types of companies are some of the easiest to spot,
monitor, and invest in during their high-growth phase. Their earnings up
cycles last for a long enough time for you to identify earnings growth “on the
table” while they still have plenty of growth in the future.

Points to Consider When Investing
in the Cookie Cutter Model
Same-store  sales,  or  what  is  also  referred  to  as  comparable  store  sales
(comps), are a very important statistic used for analysis of the retail indus-
try. This statistic compares sales of stores that have been open for a year
or more. This allows investors to determine which portion of new sales
has come from sales growth and which portion from the opening of new
stores. This analysis is important because although new stores are a major
part of a company’s expansion and earnings growth, a saturation point in
which future sales growth is determined by same-store sales growth even-
tually occurs. With these comparisons, analysts can measure sales perfor-
mance against other retailers that may not be as aggressive in opening new
locations during the evaluated period. You want to see same-store sales
increasing  each  quarter.  High-single-digit  to  moderate-double-digit
same-store sales growth is high enough to be considered robust but not
so high that it’s unsustainable (25 to 30 percent or more same-store sales
growth is deﬁnitely unsustainable over the long term). In general, same-
store sales growth of 10 percent or more is considered healthy.

What factors affect same-store sales? The two main factors are prices
and customer volume. By measuring the sales increase or decrease in stores
that have been open a year or more, you can get a better feel for how a com-
pany is really performing, because this measure—same-store sales—takes
store closings and chain expansions out of the mix. Rising same-store sales
means that more customers are buying product at the stores or are spend-
ing more than they did a year ago or some combination of the two. This is a
sign that management’s marketing efforts are paying off and that the brand
is popular with consumers.

100

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

Falling same-store sales obviously represents a problem. Weakening

comps could mean one of a few things:

(cid:115)(cid:0) The brand is losing strength, and people aren’t shopping at the

company’s stores.

(cid:115)(cid:0) The economy is worsening, and people aren’t interested in

shopping anywhere.

(cid:115)(cid:0) The company has too many items at discount prices, and dollar

volume per customer is less than usual.

Some companies grow by franchising their business or through a com-
bination of company-owned and franchised stores. Although franchise fees
can lead to big proﬁts for the franchisor, the earnings are considered lesser
quality than a company-owned base with less earnings stability. If the com-
pany franchises a relatively high percentage of new store openings, the risk
of store failures and an earnings disappointment is heightened. In 2007,
McDonald’s, one of the best- run franchise cookie cutter models in history,
had about 60 percent of its restaurants operated by franchisees.

Another important consideration for the cookie cutter model (par-
ticularly if the business concept is relatively new) is a past track record of
success in diverse geographic locations (Northeast, South, Midwest, inter-
national, etc.). You want to get evidence that the model is scalable. In addi-
tion, too much, too fast can be a red ﬂag. For most companies, opening
more than 100 stores per year is a number that is difﬁcult to maintain. In
2006, Starbucks opened 1,102 more stores than it had the previous year;
Starbucks’ stock price peaked and fell 82 percent over the next 24 months.
By 2011, Starbucks had fewer stores open than it did in 2008. Other key met-
rics to consider include comparing sales per square foot and sales per dollar
of capital invested per unit with other companies in the same business.

The Top Competitor: Keep Your Eye
on the Competition

Usually only one, two, or possibly three companies truly lead an industry
group. If I asked you to name the number one and number two soft drink

  C H A P T E R   6   C A T E G O R I E S ,   I N D U S T R Y   G R O U P S ,   A N D   C A T A LY S T S

companies, you would almost surely say Coca-Cola and Pepsi. If I asked
you who was number three, could you give as quick an answer? How about
coffee—Starbucks  and  Dunkin’  Donuts  perhaps?  Or  home  improve-
ment—Home Depot and Lowe’s? Keep in mind that we’re looking for the
next superperformers, the Starbucks, the Apple, the Google of tomorrow.
In 1981, MCI Communications challenged the dominant market leader
AT&T. MCI reported strong earnings as the stock price emerged from a
17-week consolidation and made a new high on April 2, 1981, but that was
only the beginning. Over the ensuing 22 months MCI’s stock advanced
500 percent.

A  top  competitor  may  not  be  the  superior  company  in  an  indus-
try group or even have superior products compared with the true market
leader; rather, it’s in the right place at the right time. Even though it may be
in the same rapidly growing industry as the market leader, the company’s
products or stores may be less popular or in some way inferior to those of
the leader. These “competitor” companies can also produce high rates of
earnings growth and enjoy large-scale price advances, albeit inferior to that
of the leader. Even so, the number two company in an industry can even-
tually take market share from the leader and in some cases take over the
number one spot. The stock prices of top competitors can reﬂect this phe-
nomenon, performing relatively well while the market leader digests its pre-
vious stock gains.

From 1990 through 2000, Home Depot’s stock price advanced 3,700
percent, more than a 40 percent compounded annual rate of return. During
that period, Lowe’s stock advanced only 1,000 percent, amassing only about
a quarter of Home Depot’s price advance. Then, from January 2000 through
January 2004, Lowe’s stock price ran up more than 100 percent while Home
Depot’s stock price actually fell, giving back more than 40 percent from its
all-time high. This put the 14-year track record for Lowe’s up 2,900 per-
cent and for Home Depot up only 1,800 percent. Home Depot had been the
leader for more than a decade, and for investors who saw its potential, it was
just a matter of when they got on board.

Always track the top two or three stocks in an industry group. The
online access provider America Online was the clear leader in the Internet
market until the search engine Yahoo! moved into the top slot. Google, a

102

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

director competitor to Yahoo!, then went public and is now considered the
number one powerhouse in search engines. A competitor of the market
leader can offer a great investment opportunity, especially if it’s in a strong
industry group. Like a NASCAR racer who follows in the leader’s draft, wait-
ing to make a pass at the right moment, a top competitor can ride the heels
of a market leader and eventually win market share. You should concentrate
on the top two or three stocks in a group: the leaders in terms of earnings,
sales, margins, and relative price strength. This is especially true if the indus-
try group is a leading sector during a bull market.

Netflix Goes Public; Blockbuster Tops
It’s no coincidence that within only 15 trading days of Netﬂix going public,
Blockbuster Video’s stock permanently topped out. It makes sense; com-
petition rears its head, providing a more convenient solution to the movie
rental business. Blockbuster’s stock price topped at the same time Netﬂix
came on the scene, almost as if the dollars from its shares were rotating
directly out and into its new competitor. I could see this story unfolding in
my own neighborhood as the mom-and-pop video rental stores went out
of business one by one. Then the small regional chains started closing their
doors, and the writing on the wall was beginning to look crystal clear; brick-
and-mortar video rental was on its way out.

Coming off the market bottom in 2009, Blockbuster was plagued with
declining sales as the stock traded as low as $0.13. This was off a high of
$18.00! Meanwhile, on March 18, 2009, just seven days after the Nasdaq
Composite traded at its bear market low and only 10 days after the Dow
traded at its bear market low of 6,469, Netﬂix hit an all-time high. Just 17
trading days later Netﬂix’s stock price was up an additional 20 percent.
Sales had been brisk and accelerating over the previous three quarters from
11 percent to 16 percent and 19 percent, respectively. Earnings were even
more impressive, up 36 percent, 38 percent, and 58 percent, respectively.
In October 2009, I was buying Netﬂix shares. Netﬂix’s earnings, sales, mar-
gins, return on equity, and debt levels all were superior to those metrics at
Blockbuster. Netﬂix was trading at 32x earnings while Blockbuster traded
at just 2x earnings. Which stock was really the “cheap” stock? From the

point at which Netﬂix when public, the stock increased more than 3,400
percent. During the same period Blockbuster’s stock price lost 99 percent
of its value.

The Institutional Favorite

Institutional favorites are also referred to as quality companies or ofﬁcial
growth stocks, but don’t let those titles impress you too much. These are
mature companies, and they’re certainly no secret. They generally have a
good track record of consistent sales and dividend growth, and they often
attract conservative institutional capital because of their proven history
of management’s ability to increase earnings, expand margins, and create
shareholder value. Their earnings growth is generally in the low to mid-
dle teens. These companies are regarded as the ones that most likely won’t
go out of business. Often they are referred to as blue chips or stalwarts.
Examples include Coca-Cola, Johnson & Johnson, and General Electric, to
name a few. Although all that sounds good, there’s one problem: they’re
usually big and sluggish by the time they reach institutional favorite status.
Although their earnings are deemed to be consistent and of high quality,
usually the growth is slow, and the companies are so widely followed that
there’s little room for rapid price appreciation.

In certain markets these stocks can come into favor and do quite well.
However, you’re not likely to get a superperformance move out of General
Electric or Procter & Gamble. Sometimes mismanagement, some other mis-
fortune, or a severe bear market correction will drive some of these compa-
nies down precipitously. As the stocks recover, they can make a nice advance
coming out of the correction phase.

The Turnaround Situation

Big proﬁts can be made in troubled companies that turn around. In pur-
chasing a turnaround situation, you should look for companies that have
very strong results in the most recent two or three quarters. You should

  C H A P T E R   6   C A T E G O R I E S ,   I N D U S T R Y   G R O U P S ,   A N D   C A T A LY S T S

105

see at least two quarters of strong earnings increases or one quarter that
is up enough to move the trailing 12-month earnings per share to near
or above its old peak. In looking at turnarounds, ask yourself: Are proﬁt
margins recovering, and are they at or close to the peak? Are the results
based only on cost cutting? What is the company doing to increase earn-
ings beyond cost cutting, productivity enhancements, and shedding losing
operations? How much cash does the company have? Although a company
can burn its cash, you can try to assess the burn rate and debt load to get
an idea of how long it can last while running in the red. How much debt
does the company have? Bank debt is the worst kind and is less favorable
than bond debt. How long can the company operate while it works out its
problems?

It’s important to follow the story and ascertain whether the turn-
around is running better than, worse than, or as expected. Worse than
expected is usually a reason to consider selling. I look for acceleration in
the growth rate in the most recent couple of quarters compared with the
three- and ﬁve-year growth rate, which often is negative or reﬂects very
slow growth. The most important questions to ask in purchasing a turn-
around are: Is the stock acting well in market? and Are the fundamentals
coming in strong? You want to see both. Turnaround stocks are up against
relatively easy comparisons from earlier quarters, and so it’s important to
see the most recent results up signiﬁcantly: generally 100 percent growth
or more in the most recent two or three quarters and a dramatic accelera-
tion versus the past growth rate.

Remember, stocks don’t necessarily stay in one category forever. This
is why it’s important to understand the dynamics that are taking place with
regard to a company’s products and services and the potential for sales
growth. Apple Computer was a turnaround situation that morphed into a
growth stock and since then has reached institutional favorite status. From
2001 to 2003, revenue and margins were under severe pressure, which in
turn led to lackluster earnings and a falling stock; the price of Apple’s shares
was down more than 80 percent from its high. Things were so bleak that
when Michael Dell, founder of rival computer maker Dell Inc., was asked

what he would do if he ran Apple, he said he would “shut it down and give
the money back to the shareholders.’’

However, a new product can bring new life to a dormant company, and
the release of the iPod in 2001 and iTunes stores in 2003 was about to fuel
what has been called the greatest turnaround in corporate history. From
2003 to 2011, Apple’s net proﬁt margins increased every year from just 1.2
percent to an impressive 23.9 percent. During that period, revenue growth
averaged 39 percent per year. With the rapid expansion of margins and
strong sales, earnings soared, averaging 114 percent per year. From its 2003
low, Apple’s stock price increased in value by more than 10,000 percent; 73
percent of that phenomenal growth came from newly launched products.

Cyclical Stocks

Buying a cyclical after several years of record earnings and when the

P/E ratio has hit a low point is a proven method for losing half your

money in a short period of time.

—Peter Lynch

A cyclical company is one that is sensitive to the economy or to commodity
prices. Examples include auto manufacturers, steel producers, paper stocks,
and chemical companies. Interestingly, cyclical stocks have an inverse P/E
cycle, meaning they generally have a high P/E ratio when they are poised
to rally and a low P/E near the end of their cycle. This is due to the fact that
Wall Street analysts try to anticipate the earnings-cycle dynamics of these
companies, which are dependent on the business cycle. Growth investors
may become confused when they attempt to apply an earnings model to the
selection process for cyclical stocks, and their stock picks do not respond
like a cookie cutter retailer or a high-growth technology company poised for
many continued quarters or even years of growth after earnings are already
on the table. This is the reason I put them into their own category and apply
a slightly different approach from what I do with stock categories that have
sustainable growth prospects.

With cyclical stocks, the trick is to ﬁgure out whether the next cycle
turn is going to happen earlier or later than usual. Inventories and supply
and demand are important variables in analyzing the dynamics of cyclical
stocks. When the P/E ratios of cyclical stocks are very low after earnings
have been on the rise for many months or several years, it’s often a sign that
they’re near the end of their up cycle. When P/Es are superhigh and you’ve
heard nothing but doom and gloom about the company or industry for an
extended period, the bottom may be near.

At the bottom of a cyclical swing, the following things happen:

1.  Earnings are falling.

2.  Dividends may be cut or omitted.

108

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

3.  The P/E ratio is high.

4.  News is generally bad.

At the top of a cyclical swing:

1.  Earnings are moving up.

2.  Dividends are being raised.

3.  The P/E ratio is low.

4.  News is generally good.

Stay Away from the Laggards

A laggard is a stock that belongs to the same group as the market leader but
has inferior price performance and in most cases inferior earnings and sales
growth. These stocks can have periods of decent performance, usually brief
ones, as they try to catch up with the true leaders near the end of a cycle or
during times when a sector is red hot and the real leader has run up rapidly.
The price moves in laggard stocks, however, usually pale in comparison to
those of the true market leader.

Laggards usually appear to be relatively cheaper than market leaders,
and that attracts unskilled investors. Don’t be tempted by a stock with a
relatively low P/E or one that hasn’t appreciated as much as has the leader
in its industry. There’s always a reason why one stock trades at a high
multiple and another trades at a low multiple. More times than not, the
expensive market leader is actually cheap and the laggard is really the more
expensive choice.

Over the years, many people thought buying Wild Oats, the smaller
rival to Whole Foods, was a better way to play the healthy food trend because
of its lower P/E. There was a good reason for the low P/E: Wild Oats failed to
generate much in the way of earnings growth. Investors who concentrated
on earnings growth made a lot more money by owning Whole Foods even
though it was popularly perceived to be more expensive than Wild Oats.

Whole Foods rarely traded below 30 times earnings during its dramatic
growth phase. On the surface, it’s not surprising that many investors passed
on a grocer with such a high P/E, but if they had understood the growth
opportunity, the high P/E wouldn’t have mattered much. The key for Whole
Foods was its ability to expand earnings at a high rate, growing by more than
20 percent on average. By doing that, the stock paid off big for its investors.

Specific Industry Groups Lead
New Bull Markets

The formation of a bear market bottom typically begins with signs of accu-
mulation in certain market sectors or segments. In general, 3 or 4 to as many
as 8 to 10 industry groups or subgroups lead a new bull market. The market
can also have a broader theme such as growth, value, small-cap, large-cap,
and so on. The leadership groups or categories can start to stage their bull
market rallies before the broad benchmark’s bottom. For example, at the
1974 market bottom, mid-cap and small-cap stocks began to show notice-
able signs of accumulation during September and October even though the
major market indexes did not bottom until December. When a new bull
market began in March 2003, it was already apparent that investors had been
accumulating ﬁnancial, energy, and basic materials stocks, as well as mid-
caps and small-caps, for several months. How do you ﬁnd which groups
are leading? Follow the individual stocks. I like to track the 52-week new
high list. The industry groups with a healthy number of stocks hitting new
highs early in a bull market will often be the leaders. Your portfolio should
consist of the best companies in the top four or ﬁve sectors. In a bull mar-
ket, some sectors advance several hundred percent and others barely beat
the average or even underperform. There are broad sectors that include a
wide range of companies and subgroups. Healthcare/medical, technology,
services, basic materials, consumer cyclical, consumer noncyclical, ﬁnancial,
transportation, capital goods, energy, and utilities are all broad sectors.

In  each  sector  there  are  subsectors  or  industry  groups.  For  exam-
ple,  in  the  healthcare/medical  sector,  subsectors  include  drugs,  generic
drugs, ethical drugs, biotechnology/genetics, HMOs, hospitals, nursing

homes, outpatient/home care, medical equipment, medical services, and
medical supplies.

Buying into the leading areas early in a bull market can lead to signiﬁ-
cant capital gains. Some groups start emerging late in a bull cycle and can
lead during the next upturn after a bear market. It’s deﬁnitely worth inves-
tigating the industry groups in which the most stocks were resisting the
decline and then subsequently broke into new highs while the market was
coming off its lows or during the market’s initial few rallies.

The top relative strength leaders in these groups typically lead their
group’s advance from the beginning and are likely to show the greatest
appreciation. When you see a growing number of names in a particular
industry making new 52-week highs (especially coming off a market low),
this could be an indication that a group advance is under way.

I tend to let individual stocks lead me into an industry group or sec-
tor, taking more of a bottom-up approach as opposed to top-down. I have
found that more often than not, the best stocks in the leading groups
advance before it’s obvious that the group or sector is hot. Therefore, I
focus on stocks and let them point me to the group. Not always, though.
I still stay in touch with what is happening on an industrywide level, and if
I see something that attracts my interest, I look at the stocks that make up
the industry and sort them according to my criteria. I look at the strongest
stocks ﬁrst: the ones that have the best earnings and sales, are closest to a
new high, and show the greatest relative price strength versus the market.
This is where you ﬁnd the real market leaders.

History shows that big winning stocks tend to favor certain indus-
try groups. The groups that have produced the largest number of super-
performance stocks include the following:

(cid:115)(cid:0) Consumer/retail

(cid:115)(cid:0) Technology, computer, software, and related

(cid:115)(cid:0) Drugs, medical, and biotech

(cid:115)(cid:0) Leisure/entertainment

New Innovations Create
New Opportunities

Material changes in underlying conditions can have a dramatic effect
on group performance. This doesn’t mean that a stock must belong to
a strong group to make a big advance or imply that a strong tide will lift
all the proverbial boats higher. Be on the lookout for new industries and
companies with market niches, specialized expertise, proprietary technol-
ogy, or a positive sector change such as deregulation. Look for new tech-
nologies or adaptations of old technologies that promise to help people
work better, live longer, and enjoy life more or that help companies cut
costs and improve productivity and efﬁciencies. Look for opportunities
in companies undergoing positive changes. You can read industry trade
magazines. You can call company representatives and ask which publica-
tions they recommend for keeping up with new industry events and hap-
penings in their ﬁeld.

When a new category is established or a company creates a new indus-
try, often it’s an extension of a broader group category. For example, US
Surgical was a medical products company. After it pioneered the surgical
staple in 1987, a whole new medical approach became its own niche. In the
early 1990s, US Surgical introduced the Endo Clip, which allowed lapa-
roscopic gallbladder removal, and the market for those devices began to
grow rapidly. Soon, laparoscopy was also being used for hernia operations,
appendectomies, hysterectomies, and other types of abdominal surgery.
With a virtual monopoly on sales of the equipment for these operations,
US Surgical saw its sales grow by 50 percent in 1990 and 75 percent in the
ﬁrst half of 1991. Earnings during that time grew by 78 percent, and by the
end of the year they had nearly doubled. US Surgical sold more than $300
million worth of laparoscopic equipment in 1991 to become one of the
fastest-growing companies in the United States, with proﬁts of $91 mil-
lion. Just a few years earlier US Surgical had sold only $10 million worth of
laparoscopic tools; by 1992 the company’s revenues for the year surpassed
$1 billion.

Group Cycle Dynamics

Events in one industry group can have an effect on other industry groups.
For instance, the Iraq war and the 9/11 terrorist attacks had a dramatic effect
on military and defense companies. This in turn had an effect on electronic
parts manufacturers, in particular, companies that manufactured delicate
measuring devices. In the 1990s, healthcare reform boosted HMOs, and
that produced a need for cost-containment companies and software to help
those companies deal with patients and logistics. The advent of the personal
computer had a direct effect on semiconductors. The proliferation of small
handheld devices produced demand for one-inch hard drives. High energy
prices in the period 2006–2008 and ever-increasing worldwide energy use,
as well as increased levels of pollution, have led to the proliferation of solar
and alternative energy technology. Personal computing created the need for
software and peripherals, which in turn led to the widespread use of the
Internet, creating the need for faster speed and broadband access. Now we
see social media and cloud computing as new frontiers. You can be assured
that future growth areas will show up in leading stocks of leading industry
groups.

When the Leader Sneezes,
the Group Can Get a Cold

Just as leading stocks can at times foretell a powerful group advance, keep-
ing an eye on the top two or three companies in an industry group could
provide a tip-off to when the group may be headed for trouble. It’s impor-
tant to keep your eye on important leading names in the top-performing
sectors. Often you’ll see an important stock in a group break badly, and
the whole group will suffer. If one or more important stocks in an industry
group top, that could be a warning that the whole group will soon run into
trouble. Even stocks that are outside the group, such as suppliers and cus-
tomers, may share in the suffering. Historically, more than 60 percent of
superperformance stocks were part of an industry group advance. It pays to
keep an eye on an industry’s top stocks to get a feel for that group’s potential

114

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

strength. However, if a key leader breaks down after a big advance, beware.
This is often the initial symptom that the entire group is about to get sick.

New Technologies Become Old Technologies

Every innovation eventually ceases to be an innovation; in doing so, it fol-
lows a path of market penetration and eventual saturation. This is a time-
less truth. Initially, every new innovation (railroads, automobiles, radios,
televisions, computers, the Internet, etc.) begins at a relatively high price
point that only a small market segment can afford. Progress in technology
and manufacturing gradually reduces the relative price of the new product.
This leads to market penetration in which more and more potential users
can acquire the new product or service. At some point market saturation is
reached: all ﬁrms or households that will buy and use the new product have
access to it; good examples are the automobile and the television. The mar-
ket becomes largely a replacement market with overall unit growth bounded
by the slow growth of the economy overall.

Once a market reaches saturation, little room remains for further pen-
etration. Relative price declines have less and less of a positive impact on
unit sales. The industry ceases to be a growth industry. In some cases, tech-

nological and manufacturing progress may lead to price declines that exceed
consequent increases in unit sales. During such periods of market satura-
tion, competitive pressures usually lead to severe declines in proﬁt margins.
A former growth industry geared to rapid sales expansion enters a period of
consolidation in which competition becomes unusually intense. Such peri-
ods of consolidation are usually characterized by proﬁt rates well below the
prior industry average, a decline in the number of companies in an industry,
and bankruptcies. In the 1980s and 1990s, the PC-based high-tech industry
underwent such a process of market penetration. This was no different from
the experience of the automobile industry in the 1920s and the television
industry in the 1950s; however, the cycle moved at a faster pace, probably
as a result of the increase in information ﬂow and access to world markets.

Fundamentals

to Focus On

W hen  a  stock  suffers  a  major  break in price, there’s a

reason,  and  very  often  it’s  the  beginning  of  lower  prices  to
come. In almost every case, something is fundamentally wrong with the
company’s business or industry. Entering 2008, many of the big banks,
including Citigroup, along with their broker-dealer and investing bank-
ing cousins such as Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns, were overlever-
aged and held deteriorating balance sheets. This toxic cocktail would set
up the ﬁnancial sector for collapse as the overall economy was stunned into
a severe recession. From 2007 to 2009, former Dow component American
International Group (AIG) crashed from a high of $103 down to a minus-
cule $0.33. On September 22, 2008, AIG was removed from the Dow Jones
Industrial Index. Citigroup was removed from the Dow on June 8, 2009.

You’ve heard the old adage about buying low and selling high, so maybe
you ﬁgure this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity—that is, to buy GE,
Citigroup, or some other familiar company while it’s down in price. I bet
those who bought the blue chip carmaker General Motors in 2008 felt they
were getting a bargain, too. However, in just one year GM stock dropped to
a level not seen since 1933, shedding almost 95 percent of its value. On June
8, 2009, General Motors was also removed from the Dow Jones Industrials
Index. The fact is, no matter how big or prestigious a company is, when
fundamentals deteriorate—namely, earnings—you never know how far the
stock will fall.

What Drives Superperformance?

The stock market cares little about the past, including the status of a com-
pany. What it cares about is the future, namely, growth. Keep in mind that
our goal is to uncover superperformance stocks: shares that will far outpace
the rest of the pack. These stocks are the ones with the strongest potential,
and they seldom are found in the bargain bin. They are going strong because
of a powerful force behind them: growth—real growth—in earnings and
sales. Why buy damaged merchandise?

If  your  goal  is  to  achieve  superperformance  in  stocks,  each  com-
pany must earn its place in your portfolio by being an outstanding busi-
ness. Superperformance stocks show their strength through their ability to
improve and grow earnings, sales, and margins. These powerhouse com-
panies report quarterly results that are better than Wall Street anticipates,
with upside surprises that propel the stock higher. Don’t become enamored
with a stock selling down in price because it has a well-known name. Many

winning stocks may be companies that you never heard of before. Their
best days lie ahead, not in the past. Regardless of a company’s size, status,
or reputation, there is no intelligent reason for an investor to settle for
an inferior track record in a marketplace ﬁlled with companies with out-
standing fundamentals.

Each quarter, earnings and sales reports provide a refreshed set of statis-
tics with new names, as those with poorer prospects are often replaced with
those with greater potential. The same release of quarterly results also brings
fresh data with which to evaluate the companies already in one’s portfolio.
In this way, the portfolio naturally evolves to achieve its performance goal
through forced displacement. Stocks that continue to deliver the goods can
remain in the portfolio, and the ones that fail to perform must go.

Why Earnings?

In real estate, the mantra goes “location, location, location.” In the stock
market, it’s earnings, earnings, earnings; after all, it’s the bottom line that
counts. How much money can a company earn and for how long? This leads
to three basic questions every investor should ask when it comes to earnings:
How much? How long? and How certain? Proﬁtability, sustainability, and
visibility represent the most inﬂuential factors that move stock prices.

To understand the impact of earnings on stock prices, let’s go behind
the scenes and examine how Wall Street operates. Who moves stock prices?
Big  institutional  investors  such  as  mutual  funds,  hedge  funds,  pension
funds, and insurance companies. Many institutional investors, encompass-
ing a relatively large number of investment professionals, use investment
models that identify earnings surprises, that is, reported earnings that beat
analysts’ expectations. As soon as an earnings surprise is reported, these
opportunists will jump onboard or at least put the stock on their radar
screens as a potential buy candidate.

Most of the big institutional investors utilize valuation models that are
based on earnings estimates to determine a stock’s current worth or value.
When a company reports quarterly results that are meaningfully better
than expected, analysts who follow the stock must reexamine and revise

120

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

their earnings estimates upward. This increases the attention paid to a
stock. The upward estimate revision is going to raise institutional investors’
projected value of the company. When earnings estimates for a stock head
up, shares, of course, become more attractive—and invite buying.

Anticipation and Surprise

Stocks move for two basic reasons: anticipation and surprise. Every price
movement is rooted in one of these two elements: anticipation of news, an
event, an important business change, or reaction to an unexpected event
and a surprise, whether positive or negative.

Anticipation means expectation, for example, rumors that a large con-
tract may be awarded to a contractor. In anticipation of an announcement,
the stock price may advance. Once the deal is on the table and the contract is
ofﬁcially awarded, the stock could sell off. The same thing can happen with
earnings that are in line with expectations; once the announcement is made,
the stock declines because that event had already been priced into or dis-
counted in the stock price. Stocks often move in anticipation of good and
bad news and then after the fact may move in the opposite direction (i.e.,
rallying in anticipation of a favorable development and selling off when the
announcement is made). This market phenomenon may bafﬂe newbie inves-
tors. The reason for it is that the stock market prices in future events. That is
what is meant when people say the stock market is a discounting mechanism.
Although anticipation moves prices, once the expected event occurs, the
market sells on the news. Hence the old adage “Buy the rumor; sell the fact.”

Surprises can take many forms, from earnings that were far above or
below estimates to a sudden development that signiﬁcantly changes a com-
pany’s business outlook. What surprises have in common, by deﬁnition,
is that they are unexpected. Suddenly, the idea of deregulating an indus-
try catches on in Congress or a drug that seemed unlikely to win U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) approval unexpectedly gets the green light.
With earnings, results come in well above expectations for a positive sur-
prise or well below for a negative surprise.

121

The Earnings Surprise

Let’s deﬁne what Wall Street means by an earnings surprise: simply stated,
a company’s earnings are better (or worse) than the consensus of analysts’
estimates. You can ﬁnd out what the estimates are for a company’s earnings
through news sources such as Yahoo! Finance, Zacks, and Brieﬁng.com. If a
dozen analysts follow XYZ Corp. and the consensus (average) for quarterly
earnings is $0.53 per share, if the company reports results of $0.60 a share,
that will be a $0.07 positive surprise. If the company reports $0.48 a share,
that will be a $0.05 negative surprise.

A surprise could set off a ﬂurry of activity, including a wave of buying
that, in the case of a positive surprise, raises the stock price. Studies have
shown that the effects of the surprise and the postnews drift (movement in
the direction of the surprise reaction) can last for months. Efﬁcient market
theory holds that the market reacts instantaneously and fully prices in new
information completely. Experienced traders know that this theory is false
for several reasons. For one thing, it’s impossible for everybody to respond
at the exact same time. Liquidity is also a factor; only so many shares are
available to be bought and sold. Large buyers must buy over time to avoid
running a stock up too quickly, and if they sell too fast, they can crush the
stock. This is what accounts for postearnings drift, a persistent bias in the
direction of the surprise. Be on the lookout for companies that are beating
earnings estimates; the bigger the earnings surprise, the better.

The Cockroach Effect

They call it the cockroach effect because as with cockroaches, if you see
one, you can bet there are others. The same thinking applies to companies
reporting earnings surprises. If a company has posted very good quarterly
results that are much better than were anticipated by analysts, there are
probably more good quarters ahead. If a company is performing well with
earnings surprises, other companies in the same industry or sector may post
some upside surprises as well.

Figure 7.2  Urban Outﬁtter (URBN) 2003–2007
Fueled by persistent positive earnings surprises, the price of Urban Outﬁtter
rose dramatically from 2003–2005. In contrast, from 2006–2007, a period
dominated by negative surprises, the stock was essentially unchanged.

The prospect of further surprises may lead to speculation by institu-
tional investors in some stocks even before the earnings come out. Such a
strategy can be proﬁtable. An authentic earnings surprise for the quarter
probably portends higher earnings in the next quarter as well. The mirror
effect often holds true for negative surprises. Companies that miss earnings
estimates often disappoint again in subsequent quarters. Because earnings
surprises have a lingering effect, we want to focus on companies that beat
estimates and avoid ﬁrms that have negative earnings surprises. One way
to ﬁnd candidates is to check to see if earnings reported in the last couple of
quarters were better than expected.

Not All Surprises Are Created Equal

Not all surprises are really surprises. Sometimes a company will beat the
published consensus number; for example, Company XYZ reports earnings
of $1.23 a share versus the Street estimate of $1.20. Although that’s a $0.03
upside surprise, don’t be unduly impressed with companies that beat ana-
lysts’ estimates. News reports often emphasize that companies’ announced
earnings beat analysts’ estimates by a penny or two a share; this isn’t any-

C H A P T E R   7   F U N D A M E N T A L S   T O   F O C U S   O N

123

thing new. Companies more often than not beat their estimates. This hap-
pens because they’re careful to guide expectations in their public statements
during the quarter, ensuring that analysts’ estimates converge around a
number slightly below what management knows the company will deliver.
It’s also partly due to a herd effect among analysts who don’t want their
quarterly forecasts to be too far above or below the average of their peers.

Analysts are typically conservative in making earnings estimates. Since
the market likes upside surprises and Wall Street ﬁrms are in the busi-
ness of selling stocks to consumers, you can see how this happens. When it
comes to estimates, there is no beneﬁt to being aggressive. If the majority
of analysts are between, say, $0.25 and $0.30 a share in their earnings esti-
mates and the consensus is $0.27, who would want to crank up the earnings
model to project $0.40 a share? Even a better than expected earnings report
could look like an earnings disappointment; the stock could get clobbered,
and as a result, the analyst could be out of a job. Being conservative and
safe within a reasonable range of the consensus number makes everybody
happy, especially if the company beats the estimates. Although it may look
good on the surface, don’t be fooled into thinking this is a true upside sur-
prise. You are looking for a signiﬁcant event with results that beat estimates
by a meaningful margin.

Years ago, it was popular to discern the whisper number on the Street,
a shadowy ﬁgure that was more realistic than the published estimate or
consensus. The whisper number existed because company management
once could legally share information within a closed circle of certain ana-
lysts; those analysts in turn would share that information with their big-
gest clients.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 silenced the whisper number with
stricter  rules  that  required  companies  to  disseminate  information  in  a
more restricted fashion, with stiff penalties for violations. Even earlier, the
Securities and Exchange Commission in August 2000 adopted Regulation
FD (Fair Disclosure) to address “non-public information” (information
that had not yet been announced) that could be disclosed by publicly traded
companies. In general, the rule states that if a company releases certain
information to certain individuals, such as analysts, it also has to make a

124

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

public disclosure of that information. The purpose of the rule is to promote
“full and fair disclosure,” according to the SEC.

Analysts’ Revisions of  Estimates

When a company reports a meaningful earnings surprise, analysts who
follow that stock are likely to revise their earnings estimates. I like to see
estimates raised not only for the current quarter but also for the current
ﬁscal year. Studies have shown that when estimates are revised upward by
5 percent or more, stocks tend to show better-than-average performance.
Conversely, with downward revisions of 5 percent or more, stocks exhibit
lower than average performance.

Generally, adjustments to estimates following an earnings surprise are
made shortly after the announcement. Sometimes, however, estimates are
raised before an earnings report, for example, in the middle of the quarter.
This reﬂects the expectation of good results. It may be that a product is sell-
ing better than expected or business conditions have improved. Analysts
who follow companies very carefully revise their estimates not only based on
historical data but also because of what they learn by talking with customers
and suppliers.

As the reporting period approaches, estimates probably will start to
converge around the consensus estimate. It’s your job to watch a stock to get
an idea of whether the price is already anticipating these expected results.
Also note that when analysts raise their earnings estimates on the basis of the
latest results, this lowers the price/earnings (P/E) ratio of a stock because the
denominator—earnings—is larger.

To calculate future earnings, analysts start with a revenue projection,
such as all the contracts that a company has or says it will have. Then they
apply the company’s expected proﬁt margin and subtract a certain percent-
age for taxes. The result is the earnings per share for the quarter or the year.
Most of the inputs for an estimate come from company guidance in the
form of press releases, conference calls, and personal one-on-one discus-
sions with executives. The analyst may adjust the numbers in the earnings
forecast on the basis of conversations with customers who may indicate that

C H A P T E R   7   F U N D A M E N T A L S   T O   F O C U S   O N

125

Figure 7.3  Earnings estimate revisions

sales are not as good as projected or, conversely, better than the company
has stated. Or the analyst may determine that the company is going to qual-
ify for a lower tax rate. A competitor may be about to announce lower pric-
ing, which will lead to a price war that will grind down proﬁt margins.

Look  for  companies  for  which  analysts  are  raising  estimates.
Quarterly  as  well  as  current  ﬁscal  year  estimates  should  be  trending
higher; the bigger the estimate revisions, the better. At  the  very  least,
I like to see the current ﬁscal year or the next year’s estimates trending
higher from 30 days earlier; if both are trending higher, that is even better.
Although I won’t necessarily disqualify a stock as a buy candidate if it lacks
upward earnings revisions, large downward estimate revisions are deﬁnitely
a red ﬂag.

Big Earnings Attract Big Attention

When a company delivers several quarters of strong earnings, this not only
prompts more upward revisions of analysts’ earnings estimates and broker-
age upgrades but also results in more coverage of the stock as additional
investment houses assign analysts to follow the company. More upbeat
analysis can lead to more buying. The stock, which was hardly noticed just
a few quarters ago, is starting to attract attention and bask in the limelight.
If earnings accelerate quarter by quarter at a strengthening pace, earn-
ings per share (EPS) momentum can propel the share price even higher. As

126

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

EPS momentum builds—for example, 10 percent earnings growth, then 30
percent, 50 percent, and so on—the earnings momentum buyers will jump
on the bandwagon. A feeding frenzy is now under way, all of it fueled by EPS
growth and expectations of future growth.

As the stock’s price rises quickly because of the prospects of improv-
ing fundamentals from institutional buying, additional quantitative mod-
els kick in and price momentum players start to buy the stock purely on the
basis of a strong price trend and price momentum. Some of these investors
will buy stocks that show strong price action regardless of the fundamentals.
They believe that a stock that is rising strongly will continue to rise over the
short to intermediate term purely as a result of momentum.

At some point, the growth becomes obvious and essentially everybody
knows about it. The stock is ofﬁcially termed a growth stock. The smart
money that got in early is getting out with a hefty proﬁt, and naive inves-
tors step in to buy what they’ve been reading about in the ﬁnancial pages or
hearing about on TV. Then the momentum stalls. What follows is the loss
of EPS momentum, an eventual negative earnings surprise, and downward
revisions, all of which puts considerable pressure on the stock price. This
earnings maturation cycle happens time and time again, market cycle after

Figure 7.4  Earnings maturation cycle

In order to ﬁnd your next superperformer, look for stocks that are in stage 2 with

strong earnings, positive surprises, and upward revised estimates.

C H A P T E R   7   F U N D A M E N T A L S   T O   F O C U S   O N

127

market cycle. The key is to understand where you are in the cycle and take
advantage of its effect.

Get It on the Table

Big earnings will eventually attract the big players and create the conditions
for big price performance. The length of time a stock remains in stage 2
depends on the company’s fundamentals, speciﬁcally, how long it’s able to
continue its pattern of strong earnings growth. Some companies can keep
this up for quite a stretch. To take advantage of this phenomenon, you don’t
need to guess or predict, and you don’t have to settle for less than stellar per-
formance in terms of fundamentals. Look for stage 2 uptrends supported by
strong earnings growth, and you will dramatically increase your chances for
attaining big success in stocks.

Sometimes a company with a rocketing stock price may not be mak-
ing much money, but the rising price means that investors are hoping that
it will be proﬁtable in the future. However, three out of four times, the very
best performers will show meaningful earnings increases in the most recent
quarter from the same quarter a year earlier. You should demand not only
that the most recent quarter be up by a meaningful amount but that the
past two or three quarters also show good gains.

In fact, it’s even better if the earnings are getting stronger sequentially
each quarter. In our study of past superperformance stocks, as well as in the
Love and Reinganum studies, current quarterly earnings showed the highest
correlation with big stock price performance.

To ensure that your stock is attractive to institutional investors, demand
that a minimum level of current quarterly earnings performance be met
before investing. Many successful growth managers require a minimum of
20 to 25 percent year-over-year increases in the most recent one, two, or
three quarters. The greater the percentage increases, the better. Really suc-
cessful companies generally report earnings increases of 30 to 40 percent
or more during their superperformance phase. In a bull market you can set
your minimum even higher; look to ﬁnd companies delivering increases in
earnings of 40 to 100 percent or more in the most recent two to three quar-

128

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

ters. Companies that report four, ﬁve, or six strong quarters in a row pro-
vide even more assurance that they are on the right track.

It’s important to know when the companies in your portfolio and the
ones on your watch list will report quarterly earnings. It’s not uncommon
for a company to issue a preannouncement about its results before the
actual earnings date. You should, in addition, be aware of earnings reports
and news from companies that are in the same industry group as the stocks
you hold.

The following are some examples of big winners that had their earnings

on the table when they made a large-scale advance in price:

(cid:115)(cid:0) March 1989 through May 1993: Cisco Systems (CSCO) reported
15 out of 17 quarters of earnings increases of 100 percent or
more, with the other two quarters at 92 percent and 71 percent,
respectively. Cisco’s stock price advanced more than 13-fold
during this period.

(cid:115)(cid:0) September 1989 through December 1992: Home Depot (HD)

reported 14 consecutive quarters of earnings in excess of 29 percent;
Home Depot’s stock price advanced more than 500 percent.

(cid:115)(cid:0) From 1987 through 1991, Microsoft (MSFT) reported only one

quarter below 36 percent for 16 straight quarters. The stock price
advanced more than 1,200 percent.

(cid:115)(cid:0) Apollo Group (APOL) reported 45 consecutive quarters at or

above Wall Street’s estimates. Apollo’s stellar price performance
qualiﬁes it as one of the greatest stock market winners of
all time.

(cid:115)(cid:0) From 2009 through 2011, Green Mountain Coffee Roasters

(GMCR) averaged quarterly earnings increases of 112 percent and
quarterly sales increases of 67 percent. The stock price advanced
more than 650 percent in 24 months.

(cid:115)(cid:0) Amgen (AMGN) averaged quarterly earnings increases of 288

percent during its phenomenal run in the early 1990s.

Crocs: Getting In and Getting Out at the Right Time
Crocs Inc. (CROX) was a ﬂash-in-the-pan retail fad, similar to a sneaker
company I traded in the 1980s called LA Gear. Both had meteoric price
surges in a relatively short period because of rapid sales of their trendy shoes.
Initially priced at $9.90, Crocs opened up 200 percent at $30 per share on
February 8, 2006. Crocs boasted triple-digit earnings per share every quar-
ter from June 2006 until September 2007. From its initial public offering
through October 2007, quarterly earnings per share averaged 229 percent.
The stock advanced a whopping 400 percent during that period.

Hot one-product stocks that go from unknown to all the rage overnight
can be great investments if you get in and get out at the right time. Crocs
skyrocketed while business was booming, albeit brieﬂy. There are count-
less examples of companies that produced huge earnings growth as a result
of a cyclical fad. While a product is selling rapidly, there can be a great deal

Figure 7.5  Crocs 2006–2009
Crocs Inc. (CROX) beneﬁted from rapid sales of its trendy shoes, which
translated into six consecutive quarters of triple-digit earnings growth and a very

of enthusiasm over the company’s shares. Whatever the reason, some sort
of positive development in the company is accelerating the growth rate and
the share price. Although this rate of growth is not sustainable forever—no
company can do it indeﬁnitely—it may last for 6, 9, or 12 quarters or even
longer with strong EPS momentum. If you get onboard during this period
of strong earnings growth, the stock can rally 100 percent or even rise by
300, 500, or in some rare instances 1,000 percent over a year or two.

Vicor: Triple-Digit Earnings Propels Stock
The  earnings  cycle  phenomenon  is not  a  one-time  event  or  something
unusual. It happens time and time again, market cycle after market cycle.
The only thing that changes are the names. In 1991, I purchased shares of
the electronic equipment manufacturer Vicor Corporation (VICR), which
advanced more than 400 percent in less than a year. This was due to a rapid

Figure 7.6  Vicor (VICR) 1990–1993

Vicor (VICR) sported ﬁve quarters of triple-digit EPS growth, which fueled a 460

percent share price advance in 14 months.

C H A P T E R   7   F U N D A M E N T A L S   T O   F O C U S   O N

131

earnings spurt from sales of a patented approach to providing the electricity
used for sensitive electronic equipment called a zero current switch. From
September 1990 through September 1991, Vicor reported triple-digit per-
centage growth in its quarterly earnings. This was a tremendous perfor-
mance that accelerated the stock price 460 percent, from a split-adjusted $4
a share to over $22.

As you can see, big proﬁts can be made while earnings growth is strong;
some price moves are meteoric. The key is to focus on the stage 2 portion of
the cycle while the company is delivering strong quarterly EPS growth.

Earnings Acceleration

In addition to large earnings increases that are better than analysts expect,
I’m looking for earnings acceleration, meaning that the growth in earnings
is larger than it was in a previous period. More than 90 percent of the big-
gest stock market winners showed some form of earnings acceleration
before or during their huge price moves.

For instance, let’s say that four quarters ago the company reported a
$0.05 decline year over year in quarterly earnings. Three quarters ago, earn-
ings were up 10 percent year over year. Then, two quarters ago, earnings were
up 28 percent, and in the most recent quarter, results are up 56 percent. That’s
three quarters of earnings accelerations. Year-over-year earnings are growing
by an increased rate sequentially, quarter to quarter. This characteristic is very
positive and has been shown to exist in most of the best performing stocks.

as a market leader. Elan rose 152 percent in 12 months.

Look for Earnings Supported by Revenue

In addition to strong, accelerating earnings per share growth, you want to
see sales exhibit the same characteristics: strong quarterly growth and accel-
eration. It’s not uncommon for new market leaders to show triple-digit
sales growth in the most recent two, three, or more quarters. In fact, some
great stock market successes deliver large quarterly sales increases consis-
tently for several years. For example, from March 2009 through December
2010, Netﬂix reported eight consecutive quarters of sales increases that
accelerated from 21 percent to 34 percent; during that period, quarterly
earnings averaged 45 percent. Netﬂix’s stock price advanced more than 500
percent. Home Depot made a 698 percent move from June 1982 to June
1983. Its sales grew 104 percent, 158 percent, 191 percent, and 220 percent,
respectively, over the four quarters leading up to this major stock-price

jump. In 2010, accelerating sales bolstered earnings and propelled shares
of F5 Networks more than 500 percent. This is what really accounts for
superior stock performance: strong earnings growth backed by brisk sales,
not accounting gimmickry. If you demand that your stock selections not
only show strong earnings but also show strong sales, you will increase your
chances of latching on to a superperformer.

Check the Trend

Generally, I look back one to two years to see if there has been some form of
earnings and sales acceleration. Life is not perfect, and so if one quarter here
or there doesn’t accelerate, it may not be a big deal. You can smooth out
quarterly results by using a two-quarter rolling average over the past four,
six, or eight quarters. Ideally, you want to see a steadily improving trend.

134

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

Figure 7.10  Example of smoothing earnings and sales using a two-quarter

rolling average

In contrast, a trend of a material deceleration, with results trending sharply
lower for several quarters or longer, should raise suspicion.

Annual Earnings

If a company is truly doing well, its success is unlikely to end overnight.
A surprisingly good earnings report could be the beginning of a string of
successful quarters. Strong quarterly results should translate into strong
annual results. Just one or two quarters of good earning isn’t going to be
enough to drive a stock’s price signiﬁcantly higher for an extended period.
One of the most successful stocks of the last several decades was Apollo
Group. From 2000 to 2004, Apollo’s stock price accelerated from $10 a share
to $96. During that period, annual EPS growth averaged almost 40 percent,
accelerating from 28 percent in 2000 to 55 percent in 2003. This is the type
of growth that fuels superperformance. In addition to quarterly growth,
look for strong annual growth.

Look for a Breakout Year

You can go back two to four years or more to a record year and see if cur-
rent earnings are breaking out above the previous trend. It can be a fairly
signiﬁcant event if earnings suddenly break out to the upside from a range
that was established over several years. Finally, check the upcoming one or
two quarters as well as the next ﬁscal year to see if earnings acceleration is
expected to continue.

Figure 7.12  Example of an earnings breakout

In this example, 2010 earnings not only break above the previous four-year trend,

but also take out the high set in 2003. This is a signiﬁcant development.

How to Spot a Turnaround Situation

Another form of earnings acceleration to look for is a turnaround situation.
A stock had been doing well but then fell on hard times. During the difﬁ-
cult period, the company probably had some negative earnings surprises, for
example, growing at a slower rate than expected, growing by only a single-
digit percentage, or perhaps reporting negative results. In some quarters,
earnings may have declined compared with the year-ago period. Then, all of
a sudden, earnings growth explodes. The company reports quarterly earn-
ings that are up 50 percent from the prior-year period, and the next quarter
it shows a greater than 100 percent year-over-year gain; in the subsequent

C H A P T E R   7   F U N D A M E N T A L S   T O   F O C U S   O N

137

quarter, results are up 150 percent. Amplifying this performance are the easy
comparisons from the prior year when the company was struggling. Now,
as things start to turn around, not only is the company able to post higher
earnings, the gains on a percentage basis look dramatically better.

With turnaround situations, investors should insist that the current
earnings be very strong (+100 percent or better in the most recent one or
two quarters). If the previous results were dismal, the company should be
doing signiﬁcantly better percentagewise in light of easy comparisons. You
could also insist that earnings and margins be at or close to a new high for
added conﬁrmation that the company is back on track.

In some cases, you can spot turnarounds and earnings acceleration by
comparing the current annual growth rate or current quarterly results with
the three- or ﬁve-year growth rate. A company that has been growing 12
percent a year and suddenly starts to show growth of 40 percent and then
100 percent could be a hot prospect.

growth rates with a triple-digit gain in Q3.

Deceleration Is a Red Flag

A company can be doing great with high-double-digit percentage growth
and then “deteriorate” to mid-double-digit growth. For another com-
pany, growing by 20 or 30 percent may be a big improvement. However,
for a company that had been growing at upward of 50 to 60 percent or
more, a growth rate of 20 to 30 percent would be a material deterioration.
Consider what happened with Dell Computer, which from 1995 to 1997
had grown its earnings per share at 80 percent annually and then declined
to around 65 percent in 1998 and 28 percent in 1999. Although this was
still decent growth, it was a material change and marked the end of the tre-
mendous move in Dell’s stock price. The stock peaked in 2000. Ten years
later Dell’s stock price was considerably lower, down more than 80 percent
from its high.

Home Depot
After a ﬁve-year period of stagnation that began in 1994, when Home Depot
was clearly in a sideways stage 1 pattern, the stock entered an acceleration
phase in 1997. Earnings (shown on an annual basis) rose by 21 percent that
year, followed by an increase of 37 percent in 1998 and 41 percent in 1999.
This demonstrates how a stock performs best when earnings have the stron-
gest rate of growth. Home Depot’s stock advanced from $10 a share to a
peak of over $70 a share. What fueled Home Depot’s price growth was an
average annual EPS growth rate of 27 percent, which accelerated in 1998
and 1999.

The peak for Home Depot’s stock was in 2000. After a strong earnings
performance in 1999 with a 41 percent growth rate, EPS momentum slowed
dramatically. In 2000, EPS growth was only 11 percent. The deceleration

Figure 7.15  Home Depot (HD) 1992–2008

Chart of Home Depot (HD) shows that strong, accelerating annual earnings

triggered a rapid rise in the stock price, followed by a long, precipitous decline as

the earnings growth rate slowed considerably.

140

brought the stock down from its lofty levels as average annual EPS growth
from 2000 to 2007 was 15 percent, almost half of what it had been during the
upward momentum phase. Home Depot shares performed poorly during
the slower-growth period. This was due to the stock price running up ahead
of its earnings and then eventually falling victim to earnings deceleration,
which can happen when a growth stock becomes too popular.

Assessing

Earnings Quality

A company can generate earnings in various ways, some not so

trustworthy; I prefer high-quality earnings. In other words, where
did the earnings come from? Did the company post better results because of
stronger sales? If sales were strong, was it only because of a single product or
one major customer? In that case, the growth is vulnerable. Or are the sur-
prisingly strong results due to an industrywide phenomenon or an inﬂux
of orders from numerous buyers? Maybe the company is slashing costs and
cutting back. Earnings improvement from cost cutting, plant closures,
and other so-called productivity enhancements walks on short legs. Such
improvements can show up from time to time, but sustainable earnings
growth requires revenue growth. Examining earnings quality gives you
perspective and rationale before you commit your hard-earned money to
a stock.

Nonoperating or Nonrecurring Income

Depending  on  how  you  examine  a  company’s  quarterly  report,  it  can
look like a roaring success or a sagging sloth; it’s all a matter of perspec-
tive. Here’s how this can happen. XYZ Corp. reports $3.01 per share versus
$2.40 the year before. This shows a hefty earnings gain of 25 percent. Looks
great, right? On closer examination you notice that XYZ Corp. reported an
“unusual gain” related to the sale of nonstrategic assets. This one-time event

141

142

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

accounted for $0.84 per share of income and is considered nonrecurring.
Therefore, this gain should be excluded from XYZ Corp’s earnings. Doing
this will result in an adjusted number of $2.17 a share, which is down 7 per-
cent from the year before. Big difference!

I’m looking for earnings that come from core operations, not from a
one-time gain or an extraordinary event. Most of the time the difference
between operating income and nonoperating income is clear-cut. Consider
a company that sells coffee; some of its stores are on company-owned real
estate, and management decides to divest some of the properties in the belief
that commercial real estate prices are high. These property transactions and
the proﬁts they generate are clearly outside of selling coffee. Therefore, any
gain on the property sale would be a nonrecurring event or extraordinary
gain that should be stripped away so that earnings reﬂect income from oper-
ations derived for the company’s core business.

Beware Massaged Numbers

Management has become adept at managing expectations and massaging
numbers in an effort to underpromise and overdeliver. The game players
may even underdeliver by dropping an earnings bomb in an effort to have
the estimate bar temporarily lowered for easy comparisons in the future.

One gimmick is to warn the public of a potential earnings problem,
which will cause analysts to lower their earnings estimates. Then the com-
pany reports earnings that are better than the lowered estimate. This will
result in an earnings surprise; however, it will be a surprise in the context
of a lower consensus comparison. If you see that estimate revisions were
recently lowered due to downside guidance, and then the company beat
expectations, this should raise a red ﬂag; the report may not be as good as it
looks on the surface.

One-Time Charge

Another smoke-and-mirrors trick is to utilize a one-time charge or a nonre-
curring charge. A company that would otherwise report weak earnings may

C H A P T E R   8   A S S E S S I N G   E A R N I N G S   Q U A L I T Y

143

in fact report a nonrecurring one-time charge that will account for a por-
tion of the earnings. It’s just a one-time expense, and business will be back
to usual, right? Wrong! Not if this practice forms a pattern. Some companies
are habitual abusers of the one-time charge. If the one-time charge is show-
ing up over and over, you should seriously question the earnings quality of
even the largest and most respected corporations engaging in this practice.

Write-Downs and Revenue Shifting

Inventories write-downs and ongoing expenses are also items to look out
for. Some companies will bottle up and store write-downs for a later date
when they’ll need them. They may choose to recognize or shift revenues or
expenses into the future or a different accounting period, which allows them
to control in which quarter they will realize charges or recognize sales. Some
companies will record revenues and accounts receivable at the time they
ship product and estimate losses only for returned merchandise. If returns
run higher than is accounted for, it could affect future earnings.

Management may also choose to shift earnings so that a hit can be
absorbed in a single disappointing quarter. By shifting earnings to have
one big down quarter, the company can beat estimates in the next quar-
ter because the previous report prompted analysts to lower their estimates,
making it easier for the company to beat the Street. You want to see earn-
ings coming from robust top-line sales, not from accounting tricks and gim-
micks.

Beware Profitability via Cost Cutting

With an understanding of the three major drivers of earnings (higher vol-
ume, higher prices, and lower costs), it pays to be cautious if a company is
delivering only on cutting costs. A company can increase proﬁts by cut-
ting jobs, closing plants, or shedding its losing operations. However,
these measures have a limited life span. Eventually, a company will have to
do something else to grow its business and increase its top line. Therefore,
check the story behind earnings growth. Make sure that it’s not because of a

144

Figure 8.1  Three ways a company can increase proﬁts

expansion.

one-time event, because sales jumped as a result of some extraordinary gain,
or because proﬁts improved only as a result of cost cutting.

Companies  with  good  potential  for  stock  price  appreciation  show
evidence that earnings growth is sustainable and will continue over some
length of time. The ideal situation is when a company has higher sales vol-
ume with new and current products in new and existing markets as well as
higher prices and reduced costs. That’s a winning combination.

In general, the best growth candidates have the ability to expand, intro-
duce new products and services, and enter new markets. They have the
power to raise prices, and they can improve productivity and cut costs. The
combination of revenue acceleration and margin expansion will have a dra-
matic effect on the bottom line.

The worst situation is when a company has limited pricing power,
its business is capital-intensive, margins are low or under pressure, and
it’s faced with heavy regulation, intense competition, or both. An example
would be the airline industry, which doesn’t have much pricing power, faces
government regulatory pressures, is very capital intensive, and is highly
commodity-sensitive because of fuel costs.

When strong earnings are reported, check the story behind the results
to make sure the good news is not due to a one-time event but is the product
of conditions that probably will continue. Your questions should include
the following:

(cid:115)(cid:0) Are there any new products or services or positive industry changes?

C H A P T E R   8   A S S E S S I N G   E A R N I N G S   Q U A L I T Y

145

(cid:115)(cid:0)

Is the company gaining market share?  A market is ultimately
dominated by just a few companies.

(cid:115)(cid:0) What is the company doing to increase revenue and expand

margins?

(cid:115)(cid:0) What is the company doing to decrease costs and increase

productivity?

Measuring Margins

The objective for any company is to retain as much money as it can from the
revenue it generates, meaning that it has the highest proﬁt margin possible.
When margins expand, the company is getting a higher price for its prod-
ucts or has found a way to improve productivity or cut expenses, sometimes
both. Increasing margins show that more proﬁts are being made for each
dollar of sales the company makes.

Margin metrics come in different varieties. Gross margin reﬂects how
much more customers pay for a product compared with the company’s
costs. It shows investors how well a company is doing in keeping its costs
in line and pricing its products. Gross margins depend on quite a few vari-
ables, some of which may be beyond the company’s control, for example,
if raw material costs were lower one quarter or if a competitor had a deliv-
ery problem that gave the company an unexpected advantage that could be
a short-lived phenomenon. The best kind of margin improvement comes
from pricing power because of strong demand for a company’s products.

Net margin is based on a company’s net income divided by sales and
reﬂects all the variables that inﬂuence proﬁtability. A falling net margin
indicates that the company is making a smaller proﬁt on its sales. This could
be due to rising costs, inefﬁciencies, or taxation. Margin pressure can cause
serious proﬁt erosion. The cause of a decline in net margins could be tem-
porary in nature, such as a short-term rise in raw material costs or tempo-
rary inefﬁciency in the production system. Far more worrisome is when the
net margin declines because prices are dropping as a result of declining cus-
tomer interest.

Figure 8.2  Apple Computer (AAPL) 2003–2011
From 2003 to 2011 Apple Computer’s stock price advanced more than 6,000
percent. During that period, net proﬁt margins expanded from just 1.2 percent in
2003 to 23.9 percent in 2011.

Apollo Group expanded net proﬁt margins from 11.7 percent in 2000 to 18.4
percent in 2003.

147

A company with a strong net margin compared with the average in the
industry has a competitive advantage. A comparison of net margin across
companies in an industry can be used to gauge the quality of management.
A well-run growth company should show consistent improvement in oper-
ating margins and net proﬁt margins.

Where the Rubber Meets the Road

No matter how good an earnings report appears to be on the surface, you
want to pay close attention to the stock’s price reaction to determine how
good the report really was or was perceived to be. One way to do this is sim-
ply to watch how the stock trades initially and over subsequent days after
the earnings release. If the report really was great, you should see a strong
stock price reaction that holds up and is supported by additional buying on
reasonable pullbacks. I like to see the stock price react strongly to the report
and hold its gains.

To determine whether the market is looking favorably on a company’s

earnings, I watch for three speciﬁc reactions:

1.  Initial response. Did the stock rally or experience a sell-off? If it
sold off, does it resume its slide after a dead cat bounce? Or, does
the stock price come roaring back?

2.  Subsequent resistance. How well did it hold its gains and resist

proﬁt taking?

3.  Resilience. Did the stock recover quickly and powerfully? Or did it

fail to rally after a pullback or, worse, sell off?

As an investor, you won’t know for sure what Wall Street is looking for
in an earnings report until you see the stock’s reaction to the report. When
an upside surprise is announced, I expect the stock price to do pretty well.

If that doesn’t happen—say, the stock goes up brieﬂy but then sells off
and is down 15 percent and can’t rally—that’s a big problem. This type of
reaction tells me that something may be wrong. Although it’s not uncom-

148

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

mon for stocks to sell off on proﬁt taking after a big rally and decline on
news, a superperformance stock will come back and resume its advance. For
a true superperformer, there should deﬁnitely not be a huge sell-off that
breaks the whole leg of the stock’s upward move.

After a company reports its earnings, my focus turns to the postearn-
ings drift (PED), which suggests that it may not be too late to buy a stock
after it has reported better than expected earnings. Even if you miss the ﬁrst
upward reaction after results are reported, the postearnings drift after a sig-
niﬁcant surprise can last for some time. Stock price movements from signiﬁ-
cant earnings surprises not only are felt right way but can have a longer-term
effect beyond the immediate price adjustments. Many studies have shown
that the effect can persist for months after an earnings announcement.

Sometimes earnings are largely discounted, meaning that expectations
for an earnings surprise were already priced in. Because such high expecta-

Figure 8.4  Lululemon Athetica Inc. (LULU) 2011–2011
Lululemon experienced post earnings drift (PED) after reporting earnings in
September and December 2010.

C H A P T E R   8   A S S E S S I N G   E A R N I N G S   Q U A L I T Y

149

tions had been discounted in the stock price, even an earnings surprise will
not satisfy the market. If earnings came in at, say, $0.05 a share over expecta-
tions but that level of outperformance was already anticipated, this will be a
disappointment to the market, which had hoped for an even bigger surprise,
say, $0.07 or $0.10 a share. Even if the consensus was $0.50 and the com-
pany reported $0.55 a share, the stock could sell off because earnings did not
come in even higher.

How do you know what the market wants other than the published
estimates? Study how the stock price responds. Was the stock rewarded
or punished when the results came in? Was an upside surprise big enough
to move share prices higher, or did the stock sell off? Even if an earnings
report appears to be a surprise, you can judge the true perception only
from the response of the share price. Unexpected surprises can have a dra-
matic effect.

In January 2010, Netﬂix shares gapped up big on its earnings report. After a brief
and shallow pullback, the stock was back in new high ground.

Company-Issued Guidance

Company-issued guidance is simply comments that management provides
publicly about what it expects in the future. These comments are also known
as forward-looking statements and generally focus on earnings, sales, and
margin expectations. Company guidance is given so that investors can eval-
uate the company’s growth potential. Under current regulations, it is the
only legal way a company can communicate its expectations to the market.
Analysts use this information in combination with their own research to
develop earnings forecasts.

Company-issued guidance plays an important role in the investment
decision process because management knows its business better than any-
one else and has ﬁrsthand information on which to base its expectations. Be
aware, however, that management can use guidance to sway investors. For
example, in a bull market some companies have given optimistic forecasts
because the market wants momentum stocks with fast-growing earnings per
share. In bear markets, companies have tried to guide expectations lower so
that they can beat the earnings projections.

Companies generally issue guidance at or near the time a quarterly
earnings report is released. Let’s say that along with reporting stronger than
expected earnings, the company issues guidance for the upcoming quarter
and the rest of the year, projecting much better earnings ahead. For exam-
ple, the company may say that for the next quarter it expects to earn $0.10
to $0.12 a share more than it previously predicted, and it also increases the
expectation for year-end results by $0.30 to $0.35 a share. Not only has the
company beaten the expectations for this quarter, it feels conﬁdent enough
that it will have good results the next quarter to go public with a statement
to that effect. Because companies are conservative about their earnings
guidance, we know that a statement like this won’t be issued unless manage-
ment thinks the results will not only meet these higher expectations but also
beat them. This is exactly what I’m looking for: better than expected earn-
ings along with positive earnings guidance. A company should not only be
doing well but be doing better than analysts anticipate.

Depending on what a company says about its business prospects going
forward, positive or negative, the response of the stock price could be dra-

C H A P T E R   8   A S S E S S I N G   E A R N I N G S   Q U A L I T Y

151

matic. In some cases, the reaction to earnings guidance is stronger than
the reaction to the actual earnings report when it is announced. By track-
ing what a company says and then what develops later on, you can ascertain
the quality and tendencies of the company’s guidance.

If you think earnings expectations don’t drive stock prices, watch what
happens when a company announces earnings that fall short of expecta-
tions even by just a few pennies or when it issues downside guidance. Rosetta
Stone Inc. (RST) raised its guidance for third-quarter and ﬁscal 2009 results
in July 2009. After a brief pullback, four days after guidance was raised, the
stock sold off and could not rally and recover. This was abnormal consider-
ing the rosy guidance. Just days later the company ﬂip-ﬂopped and issued
lower guidance, and the stock got blasted. It simply did not make sense that
the stock broke down and couldn’t rally after what should have been per-
ceived as great news. This was telling of the future. The fact that the com-

Figure 8.6  Rosetta Stone (RST) 2009–2010
Rosetta Stone shares were propelled higher when the company raised its
earnings outlook. Eleven trading days later, the stock sold off sharply when the
company unexpectedly lowered its guidance.

exploded off its lows on the second highest volume since going public.

pany lowered guidance just 11 trading days after it had raised guidance was
a bewildering red ﬂag.

As you can see from the previous Rosetta Stone example, company
issued guidance can send a stock soaring or plummeting depending on
how it is perceived by investors. In February of 2003, Dick’s Sporting Goods
(DKS) gapped up big after the company issued positive forward guidance.
The overwhelming volume was revealing; a telltale sign that institutions
took comfort from the news.

Long-Term Projections

When obliged to fess up to bad news, a publicly traded company will often
try to spin the message. It may announce a stock buyback or some other
“positive” news at the same time it reports a disappointing quarter in an
effort to soften the blow and offset any potential negative effects. This gener-

C H A P T E R   8   A S S E S S I N G   E A R N I N G S   Q U A L I T Y

153

ally doesn’t work. One feeble tactic is to issue an upbeat long-term projec-
tion at the same time they deliver bad news about an upcoming or current
quarter. In dealing with future earnings, it’s important not to look too far
out. Growth investors tend to have a “what have you done for me lately”
mentality. Therefore, focus on what the company is saying about the upcom-
ing quarter and the current ﬁscal year. My rule of thumb is to take long-term
forecasts with a grain of salt. No one, not even management, can accurately
forecast what a company will earn or what its rate of growth will be a year
or two down the road. If they say, “Business conditions will be tough this
year, but we see improvement coming next year,” that’s not positive guid-
ance. That’s spin.

Analyzing Inventories

Back when I ﬁrst started trading stocks in the early 1980s, public companies
were not required to report inventory ﬁgures; now those ﬁgures are readily
available. Inventory ﬁgures can be found in the published balance sheets of
a corporation, which are available in 10-Q (quarterly) and 10-K (annual)
ﬁlings to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Companies post
the ﬁlings on their websites; corporate ﬁlings also are available on the SEC’s
EDGAR database.

With a manufacturer or retailer, inventory and accounts receivable
analyses can provide a heads-up as to whether business conditions are likely
to improve or if the good times are coming to an end. In late 2003–2004, the
price of copper was going through the roof. This rapid escalation in the price
of a raw material, I knew, would enable manufacturers of copper products
to pass along a price increase to customers.

By examining the inventory ﬁgures in the quarterly reports of several
manufacturers, I found my candidate: Encore Wire (WIRE). Encore pos-
sessed signiﬁcant copper inventories and met the criteria of my SEPA stock
analysis. I knew I had a potential big winner in sight. Encore had a stockpile
of copper it had bought at lower prices. With the price of copper signiﬁ-
cantly higher, Encore could charge its customers signiﬁcantly higher prices
than it paid, which accounted for expanding proﬁt margins.

Figure 8.8  Price of copper and Encore Wire (WIRE) 2003–2006
A stockpile of copper bought at lower prices allowed Encore Wire signiﬁcant
margin expansion.

Compare Inventory with Sales

For certain industries, such as manufacturing, the comparison of inventory
and sales is crucial. Speciﬁcally, I look at the breakdown of inventory (i.e.,
ﬁnished goods, work in progress, and raw materials) and how each segment
relates to the others. The inventory breakdown also helps put sales in per-
spective. For example, a strong gain in sales may look impressive; however,
the company could be pushing on a string if in fact inventories are growing
much faster than sales. If the ﬁnished goods portion of inventories is rising
much more rapidly than the raw materials or work-in-progress segments,
this could mean that product is piling up. Therefore, production will slow
because the company already has a stockpile of ﬁnished goods.

C H A P T E R   8   A S S E S S I N G   E A R N I N G S   Q U A L I T Y

155

If that inventory of ﬁnished products is highly depreciable—such as
computers and certain retail goods—this could spell trouble ahead. A com-
pany sitting on a large stock of depreciating merchandise will have to slash
prices to get rid of it. Also, that aging inventory will compete in the mar-
ketplace with newer product lines. Higher-trending inventories can lead to
markdowns and write-offs, a scenario ripe for a hit on future earnings, caus-
ing the company to report a disappointing quarter.

Keep in mind that the amount of inventory by itself is not that mean-
ingful to your analysis. It’s the trend in inventories versus sales and the per-
centage increase or decrease within the inventory chain that yield valuable
information.

Think of inventory as merchandise waiting to be sold. Under most con-
ditions, inventories should rise and fall in a pattern similar to that for sales.
Management tries to anticipate future sales and stocks inventory to meet
demand or expected demand. When inventory grows much faster than sales,
it can indicate weakening sales, misjudgment by management of future
demand, or both. These scenarios are likely to undermine earnings. The more
rapidly inventory depreciates, the more excess inventory will be detrimental.

Dell’s Solution for Inventory Buildup
Companies that control their inventory the best in an environment of fall-
ing prices have the potential to hold up best and outperform the others,
especially during an economic downturn. Dell Computer responded to this
problem with its revolutionary “build-to-order” business model. The model
transformed the manufacturing business by lowering inventory stockpiles
and decreasing the risk of holding depreciating computers. Other compa-
nies have since adopted this simple concept even in industries outside the
computer business. Dell’s model is based on orders taken over the phone
and on its website. Computers are not put into production until an order
is placed. This dramatically reduced the number of days inventory was held
and increased the company’s inventory turnover ratio to more than three
times that of its rivals.

This unique new business model allowed Dell to capture higher proﬁt
margins than its competitors, gain market share, and dominate the com-

156

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

puter market during the 1990s. The reason this concept worked so well in
the computer business is that the product was highly depreciable. Virtually
all of Dell’s competitors relied on a business model that involved stock-
ing retail stores with merchandise. When business turned down, Dell’s
competitors  were  holding  large  inventories  of  merchandise,  the  value
of which was eroding with time and advances in computer performance
and capabilities. To keep their merchandise from spoiling like fruit in the
sun, Compaq, Hewlett-Packard, and Gateway were forced to cut prices to
unload their stockpiles. This condition will often show up in inventories,
with ﬁnished goods usually rising and trending upward faster than sales
and raw materials.

Not all inventory buildups are bad. Maybe a company has to ﬁll the
shelves of 20 new stores it just opened. The real red ﬂag arises when an
inventory buildup is unexplained or the explanation isn’t a good one. If you
spot an unexplained inventory buildup, you can call the company or go on
an investor conference call to ask for an explanation.

On the ﬂip side, if raw materials are suddenly building up, this could
be an indication that the company believes business will be picking up. If
that’s the case, sales should show signs of acceleration shortly afterward to
conﬁrm that the raw material buildup was indeed in anticipation of stron-
ger demand.

Analyzing Receivables

In addition to inventories, a part of a company’s balance sheet that mer-
its attention is receivables. Accounts receivable are what the company is
owed for sales it has already made. Some receivables are to be expected in
the course of doing business; it’s normal to have a reasonable delay between
delivery of products or services and receipt of payment. However, if receiv-
ables are increasing at a far greater rate than sales or if the trend is accelerat-
ing, this could be a warning that the company is having trouble collecting
from its customers.

If receivables and inventories are both increasing at a greater rate than
sales (twice or more without explanation), this could be double trouble.

Think about it. We know from the previous discussion that when invento-
ries—particularly of ﬁnished goods—rise faster than sales, that means prod-
uct is building up. The company has made more than it can sell in current
market conditions, assuming that there isn’t a good reason for the buildup,
such as the need to stock new retail outlets. This is even a bigger problem if
the inventory stockpile is of highly depreciable goods. When receivables are
also rising, the company hasn’t been paid for what it has sold to its custom-
ers. This is a double whammy that often forecasts trouble ahead: Consumers
aren’t buying, and retailers aren’t selling and therefore aren’t able to pay for
the product they’ve got. The manufacturer isn’t collecting on what it sold,
and its warehouses are full of more product than it can ship.

There could be a reasonable explanation for the rising receivables, such
as a new product line or new customers in a different industry that have
been given longer credit terms. Maybe orders have not shipped as expected
because of a production delay. Whatever the reason, it’s worth investigating
to see if this is a red ﬂag or a situation that’s easily explained.

In the example below, the rate of increase in total inventories is four
times that of sales and receivables are up three times the rate of sales. More
troubling is the fact that ﬁnished goods and work in progress are up big
relative to raw materials. This could indicate an unusually large stockpile of
goods. To the extent that those goods are depreciable, the product on hand
will be worth less and less as time goes by, eroding margins and ultimately
earnings. This type of scenario should raise a red ﬂag.

a rate faster than sales.

Differential Disclosure

When a company says one thing in one document and something quite dif-
ferent in another, you have differential disclosure. This happens far more
often than most people think. The reason is simple. Guidelines for reports
to shareholders are far less restricted than those for reports submitted to
the SEC. An example is shareholder reporting versus tax reporting. Make
a point to compare footnotes and other disclosures related to taxes under
the cash-basis accounting rules required for the Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) with the earnings reported to shareholders under accrual accounting.
If you spot a big difference, this is a red ﬂag. In a similar vein, if a company is
reporting great earnings but is not paying much in taxes, be skeptical.

Hitting on All Cylinders: The Code 33

When a company grows its sales at an accelerating rate (25 percent, then
35 percent, then 45 percent, and so on), this is great. Better still, though, is
a company that accelerates its sales and expands its proﬁt margins at the
same time. This powerful combination can ignite earnings and fuel explo-
sive stock price appreciation. The result is a condition in which the company
can grow its earnings at a much faster rate than it could if sales or margins
were accelerating only by themselves or if neither were accelerating. The best
situation for rapid earnings growth is to be hitting on all cylinders as sales
accelerate and proﬁt margins expand simultaneously.

Look for what I call a Code 33 situation, three quarters of acceleration in
earnings, sales, and proﬁt margins. That’s a potent recipe. If a company has

hot-selling products or services and a management team that’s on the ball,
the proof should show up in the sales and margins. Proﬁt margins should
improve as the company improves productivity. Sales should increase as the
company expands into new markets. If these things aren’t happening, it may
not be the optimum time to buy the stock.

Follow the Leaders

M ost  of  the  big  money made in bull markets comes in the

early stages, during the ﬁrst 12 to 18 months. However, by the
time a big advance asserts itself in the broad market indexes, many of the
best stocks may have been running up for weeks in advance. The question
then becomes how you know when to jump on board before an emerging
rally gets away from you and the very best stocks leave you in the dust. The
answer: follow the leaders.

Top-performing stocks will lead the broader market averages at impor-
tant turning points. As a bear market is bottoming, leading stocks, the ones
that best resisted the decline, will turn up ﬁrst and then sprint ahead—days,
weeks, or even months before the Dow, S&P, and Nasdaq indexes put on
their running shoes. These leading names will break into new high ground
while the major indexes are just starting to come off their respective lows. At
this point, overall market conditions still look bleak to most investors and
the news is still for the most part negative and cautionary. Later, the rally
broadens, pushing up the indexes, which propels the front-runners even
higher. Then sentiment begins to shift from fear to optimism. By paying
close attention to the market’s leading names, you can be in the best stocks
before they are obvious to the public. This is nothing new to astute stock
investors who know what to look for. The legendary Jesse Livermore built
his fortune by trading in leading stocks in the 1920s and 1930s. I made 99
percent of my proﬁts in the stock market by trading in leading names.

Market leaders tend to foretell turns to the downside as well. As a bull
market enters its later stages (generally after one or two years), many of the

161

162

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

leadership stocks that led the market advance will start to buckle while the
broad market averages march on toward their tops. Typically, a second wave
of postleadership stocks start to perform relatively well as money rotates
out of the true leaders and into some of the group’s constituents, laggard
follow-up stocks, or defensive groups such as drugs, tobacco, utilities, and
food stocks that are thought to be less sensitive to an economic downturn.
Follow-on stocks and laggards, however, rarely experience the length or,
more important, the magnitude of the price move that true market leaders
accomplish. When you see this rotation occurring, it’s a warning that the
market rally may be entering its later stage. The ultimate market top may
still be weeks or even months away, but this internal market action is a pro-
verbial shot across the bow that should get your attention.

Getting in Sync

The problem for most investors is that they fail to notice the important
nuances and clues from leading stocks near turning points, and that causes
them to lose perspective. Why? Investors are gun-shy after the market has
been declining steadily. Just about the time the market is bottoming, most
investors have already suffered large losses in their portfolios because they
refused to cut their losses short. After a market correction, many investors
are busy hoping to break even on the open losses they hold or are convinced
that the end of the world is coming because they got crushed during the pre-
vious decline and refuse to acknowledge the buy signals individual leading
stocks are offering.

Making it even more difﬁcult is the fact that leading stocks always
appear to be too high or too expensive to most investors. Market leaders are
the stocks that emerge ﬁrst and hit the 52-week-high list just as the market is
starting to turn up. Few investors buy stocks near new highs, and fewer buy
them at the correct time. They focus on the market instead of the individual
market leaders and often end up buying late and owning laggards. Adding
to the distraction is the fact that the news media are usually wrong at major
turning points. At a market bottom they’ll predict the end of the world, and
at a top the same people will say you can’t go wrong investing in stocks. It
can be very confusing if you listen to what people are saying instead of pay-

ing attention to what the stocks are telling you. More than 90 percent of
superperformance stocks emerge from bear markets and general market
corrections. The key is to do your homework while the market is down;
then you will be prepared to make big proﬁts when it turns up.

On February 4, 2010, I purchased Pharmacyclics Inc. (PCYC), and also
recommended it to our Minervini Private Access clients; this was a day
when the Nasdaq Composite Index was hitting a new low. Over the next 48
trading days, PCYC advanced 90 percent, during which time the Nasdaq
rallied only about 18 percent. The 90 percent advance proved to be only the
beginning; PCYC advanced 1,500 percent in 33 months, a clear example of
market leadership.

The Lockout
During the ﬁrst few months of a new bull market you should see multiple
waves of stocks emerging into new high ground; general market pullbacks
will be minimal and probably will be contained to 3 to 5 percent from peak
to trough. Many inexperienced investors will be looking to buy a pullback
that rarely materializes during the initial leg of a new powerful bull market,
which from the onset will appear to be overbought.

Typically, the early phase of a move off an important bottom has the
characteristics of a lockout rally. During this lockout period, investors wait
for an opportunity to enter the market on a pullback, but that pullback
never comes. Instead, demand is so strong that the market moves steadily
higher, ignoring overbought readings. As a result, investors are essentially
locked out of the market. If the major market indexes ignore an extremely
overbought condition after a bear market decline and your list of leaders
expands, this should be viewed as a sign of strength. To determine if the
rally is real, up days should be accompanied by increased volume whereas
down days or pullbacks have lower overall market volume. More important,
the price action of leading stocks should be studied to determine if there are
stocks emerging from sound, buyable bases.

Additional conﬁrmation is given when the list of stocks making new
52-week highs outpaces the new 52-week low list and starts to expand sig-
niﬁcantly. At this point, you should raise your exposure in accordance with

C H A P T E R   9   F O L L O W   T H E   L E A D E R S

165

your trading criteria on a stock-by-stock basis. As the adage goes, “It’s a
market of stocks, not a stock market.” In the early stages of a market-bottom
rally it’s absolutely critical to focus on leading stocks if your goal is to latch
on to big winners. Sometimes you will be early. Stick with a stop-loss disci-
pline, and if the rally is for real, the majority of the leading stocks will hold
up well and you will have to make only a few adjustments. However, if you
get stopped out repeatedly, you may be too early.

The Best Stocks Make Their Lows First

To make big money in the stock market, you’re going to need to have the
overall stock market’s primary trend on your side. A strong market trend
is not something you want to go against. However, if you concentrate on
the general market solely for timing your individual stock purchases, you’re
likely to miss many of the really great selections as they emerge at or close to
a market bottom.

The true market leaders will show strong relative price strength before
they advance. Such stocks have low correlation with the general market
averages and very often act as lone wolves during their biggest advancing
stage. The search for these stocks runs contrary to the thinking of most
investors, who often take a top-down approach, examining ﬁrst the econ-
omy and the stock market, then market sectors, and ﬁnally companies in a
speciﬁc industry group. As I’ll show you in several examples in this chap-
ter, many of the very best leading stocks tend to bottom and top ahead of
their respective sectors, whereas speciﬁc industry groups can lead a gen-
eral market turn. Although it’s true that many of the market’s biggest
winners are part of industry group moves, in my experience, often by
the time it’s obvious that the underlying sector is hot, the real industry
leaders—the very best of the breed—have already moved up dramati-
cally in price.

In the early stage of a relative strength leader’s uptrend, there may or
may not be much conﬁrming price strength from its group overall. This is
normal. Often there will be only one or two other stocks in the group dis-
playing strong relative strength. Therefore, it requires additional skill to pin-

effect”

laggards during a bull market and then entering a bear market phase.

point these stocks early on. As the leader’s trend continues to advance and
eventually its industry group and sector begin to show signs of strength, the
price advance of the market leader will do one of two things: it will continue
its advance while the group propels it even higher, or it will consolidate in
a sideways fashion and digest its previous gains while the group and other
stocks in the group play catch-up. This does not necessarily mean that the
leader’s price advance has ended, because leaders can zig while the market
zags; this is typical of high alpha stocks. You should look for deﬁnite signs
that the stock has topped before concluding that the move is over.

Your Window of  Opportunity

Market leaders are the stocks that can increase the value of a portfolio signif-
icantly and rapidly, the types of stocks that can produce superperformance.
By applying a bottom-up approach to ﬁnd the best relative performers in
the early stages of a bull market, you will put yourself in a position to latch

C H A P T E R   9   F O L L O W   T H E   L E A D E R S

167

on to some really big winners. The stocks that hold up the best and rally
into new high ground off the market low during the ﬁrst 4 to 8 weeks of a
new bull market are the true market leaders, capable of advancing signiﬁ-
cantly. You can’t afford to ignore these golden opportunities.

There are countless examples of market leaders that displayed obvious
signs of strength before there was a widespread indication of overall mar-
ket or industry group strength. It’s a matter of knowing what to look for.
For example, in 2001, Amazon bottomed well ahead of the market and gave
investors a year to prepare for the eventual buy point that propelled the
stock 240 percent in 12 months.

Figure 9.3  Amazon (AMZN) vs. the Nasdaq Composite Index, 2001–2003
Amazon (AMZN) turned into a stage 2 uptrend well in advance of the general
market, giving investors ample time to prepare for the buy point, which preceded
a 240 percent advance in only 12 months.

168

Market leaders tend to stand out best during an intermediate market
correction or in the later stages of a bear market. Look for resilient stocks
that hold up the best, rebound the fastest, and gain the most percentage-
wise off the general market bottom. This, too, will identify potential leading
names. After an extended bear market correction, look for stocks that hold
their ground or, even better, work their way higher while the general mar-
ket averages trend lower. A series of higher lows during lower lows in the
general averages is a tip-off that a potential market leader is in the making.
The relative strength line of the stock should show steady improvement as
the market declines. It’s important to study carefully the price action of
individual companies with new positive developments and strong earn-
ings per share during major market declines. Many of the most strongly
rebounding stocks and the ones that hold up the best are likely to become
the next up cycle’s superperformers.

Superperformance can be triggered by several factors, including a posi-
tive earnings surprise, industrywide regulatory change, governmental policy
change, newly awarded contracts, better than anticipated results from a new
product launch, and the planned introduction of a unique new product. For
a pharmaceutical or biotech company, U.S. Food and Drug Administration
approval for a promising new drug or medical device can have an enor-
mously positive effect. On July 20, 2009, shares of the small biopharma
company Human Genome Sciences (HGSI) soared, closing up more than
270 percent in just one day, but that was only the beginning. The company
unveiled test results on a drug that could become the ﬁrst new treatment for
lupus in 50 years, a drug with truly revolutionary potential. Seven months
later, HGSI’s stock price was up an additional 165 percent. Similarly, on
April 14, 2009, shares of Dendreon Corp soared almost 200 percent after the
company said its prostate cancer vaccine Provenge signiﬁcantly prolonged
the overall survival of patients compared with a placebo. Eleven months
later, the stock price was up an additional 117 percent.

There was a stark contrast between Humana’s stock price trend and
the general market price action from June 1977 to August 1978. Humana’s
stock had been in a stage 2 uptrend and was hitting a new high while the
Dow had not even turned the corner yet. Then Humana emerged into new

Figure 9.4  Humana (HUM) vs. the Dow Jones Industrial Average, 1978

high ground as the overall market initially came off its lows. Humana’s stock
price advanced 1,000 percent over the subsequent 38 months.

Humana’s action provided the type of subtle sign that few can detect
during a bear market bottom. What you are looking for as a sign of a bot-
toming market is the following:

1.  A ﬁrst wave of market leaders emerge and build bases in a stair-

step fashion, as in the Humana example.

2.  Stock set-ups proliferate while the original leaders give up

relatively little ground and rebound fairly quickly from any sell-
off.  Leading stocks will generally advance 15 to 20 percent and
then rest, during which time they may pull back 5 to 10 percent.

170

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

3.  The majority of leaders should hold their ground. Even though
there are bound to be some stocks that emerge and then fail, you
don’t want to see most of the leaders that broke out come crashing
down and not able to rally.

4.  Volume on the major averages should also be watched for signs
of distribution. If this is accompanied by increasing volume on
down days versus up days, it may be too early, and you may need
to revert back to cash for protection.

Emulex
In 2001, I bought shares of Emulex (EMEX). The stock attracted my atten-
tion for several reasons. First, as the general market was near a new low,
Emulex shot up 100 percent in only one week. This impressive strength was
the initial tip-off that something big was about to happen with the stock.
Such a surge in demand is often a reaction to a positive development that
has recently surprised the Street or an indication that something is being
anticipated.  Next,  the  stock  pulled  back  sharply,  but  it  recovered  very
quickly in only a few days. The stock gave up little ground afterward. The
price then moved into new high ground as the general market rallied off its
lows. This was the green light to buy.

GRA was up 110 percent. The Nasdaq Composite Index during that period
was up only 10 percent.

Secular Growth Cycles

Often, stocks that hold up well during bear market corrections are in their
own earnings up cycle. These stocks may beneﬁt from strong earnings and
sales, new products or services, or industry changes that positively affect
the company. However, a stock’s price trend may be temporarily held back
or muted by the weight of the bearish primary trend of the general mar-
ket. This causes a stock’s price to decline, but not as severely as the prices of
other stocks. These stocks are generally very resilient and bounce back into
new high ground quickly off their lows. When the bearish market exhausts
itself and turns up, stocks in their own earnings up cycle will blast off and
advance signiﬁcantly, in some cases for an extended period. On the ﬂip side,
stocks that are in their own bearish cycle may resist even a strong market
and go nowhere. Often this is an indication of an unfavorable outlook, and
these stocks should be avoided.

Panera Bread (PNRA) advanced an incredible 1,100 percent over 26
months during one of the most devastating bear markets in U.S. stock mar-
ket history. The Nasdaq Composite, meanwhile, declined approximately 80
percent in that period. This does not mean that you should focus on buying
stocks during major declines in the overall market; Panera Bread is clearly
not the norm. However, Panera vividly illustrates the power of the earnings
cycle when timed correctly.

A Classic Case of  Market Leadership

During the entire 1990 bear market, I observed that Amgen’s stock price
barely dropped below its 50-day moving average for any length of time. As
the market continued in a precipitous downtrend, Amgen moved sideways
and marked time. This is how a stock can improve its relative strength rank-
ing during a market correction even without the stock rallying very much.

Figure 9.9  Amgen (AMGN) vs. the Nasdaq Composite Index, 1990
Amgen held up exceptionally well and displayed strong relative strength while the
overall market was declining.

176

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

Every time the Dow rallied off its lower lows, Amgen would edge its way into
new high ground; this got my attention. Finally, in October 1990, the market
reached a bottom. Only 22 days later Amgen hit an all-time price high. The
Nasdaq Composite and other popular averages were still 25 percent off their
highs. The market indexes, however, did not discourage me. I started to buy
stocks in the healthcare group that were displaying the best earnings and
price strength. The broader market had been sitting on the stock through-
out its correction; however, once the market took off the pressure, Amgen
took off. It was one of the ﬁrst stocks to emerge in the 1990 bull market and
gained 360 percent in just 14 months,.

Look for a Technical Theme

Each market cycle has a unique signature in the form of the price and vol-
ume action in leading names. Often a similar technical theme will be pres-
ent.  A growing number of stocks displaying positive, divergent price
behavior during a general market decline can tip you off to where the next
group of market leaders may emerge or what stocks are likely to blast off
ﬁrst when the market starts to rally. When you see this type of price action,
it’s time to tune out the media and the gurus and concentrate on the facts:
price, volume, earnings, sales, proﬁt margins, new products, and positive
industry changes. Look for the evidence stock by stock and employ the best
criteria. Most of the time there will be more than just one stock in a particu-
lar industry group displaying this type of behavior. You should try to own
the top one, two, or three names in the industry in terms of relative perfor-
mance and earnings power. Look for the types of patterns and price action
that are proliferating in the marketplace. This can help you understand what
type of tactic will work best in the current cycle.

In 1990, medical-related stocks were emerging as market leaders one
after the other. Stocks such as US Surgical, United Healthcare, Amgen,
Ballard Medical Products, and Stryker, among others, were leading the mar-
ket. For many of these stocks, their relative price strength during the 1990
bear market proved to be a valuable tip-off that they were about to lead the
next bull run and score huge returns for investors. I know. I was there at the
time, buying them as they emerged.

177

Also emerging from the 1990 bear market bottom was the market leader
American Power Conversion (APCC). Like Amgen, this company caught my
attention, and for similar reasons: a stock that was starting to go higher as soon
as the market took off the brake. Founded by a group of engineers from MIT,
APCC had set out to develop solar power products, but after sharp declines
in oil prices and muted government support for solar power, the company
quickly shifted to developing uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems for
computers and workstations. The timing was perfect. APCC introduced its
ﬁrst UPS models in 1984 just as the microcomputer market began to blast off.
In 1991, APCC introduced models that sold for under $200, which opened up
the home PC market for the ﬁrst time. The rest is history.

It was no coincidence that APCC’s stock price emerged off the 1990
bear market low into new high ground on the exact day that Amgen did
(22 days into the rally). The two stocks displayed nearly identical price

strength, indicating that their up cycles were being suppressed temporarily
by the weight of the overall market correction. Selling for its highest price
ever on November 12, 1990, proved to be only the tip of the iceberg. APCC
advanced a whopping 4,100 percent over the subsequent 50 months.

Which Leaders Should I Buy First?

As you shift into buying gear, the question becomes, Which stocks should I
buy ﬁrst? It’s simple. Buy the strongest ﬁrst. Coming off a market low, I like
to buy in order of breakout. The best selections in your lineup will be the
ﬁrst to burst forth and emerge from a proper buy point and into new high
ground. The ones that act the strongest are generally the best choices at this
point. Let the strength of the market tell you where to put your money, not
your personal opinion, which rarely is a good substitute for the wisdom
of the market. Ultimately, opinions mean nothing compared with the ver-
dict of the market. The stocks that emerge ﬁrst in the early stage of a new
bull market with the greatest power are generally the best candidates for
superperformance.

At the August 2007 low, oversold conditions dominated many market-
timing indicators, which were down to levels equivalent to the 2002 and
2004 market bottoms. Most important and what caught my attention was
the fact that an increasing number of fundamentally strong companies were
emerging from sound consolidation patterns. New stock breakouts were
boosting some industry sectors out of oversold levels.

Adding to my bullish view was the fact that the previous weeks included
positive key reversals in the major averages, an improvement in advisory
sentiment and put/call ratios, and very impressive up/down volume ratios
on the Nasdaq of 9 to 1 and on the New York Stock Exchange of 21 to 1.

There was still a distinct possibility that the market could be hit with an
additional wave of selling, which would force another leg down in the major
averages. Nonetheless, I started adding many of the best names to my buy
list and covered all my short positions. My thinking was that even if the mar-
ket did sell off again, many of my stops on my longs would probably not be
violated. If they were, I would simply sell and cut my losses.

C H A P T E R   9   F O L L O W   T H E   L E A D E R S

179

When a market is bottoming, the best stocks make their lows ahead
of the absolute low in the market averages. As the broader market aver-
ages make lower lows during the last leg down, the leaders diverge and
make higher lows.  It’s  important  to  watch  very  carefully  at  this  junc-
ture and stand ready to cut your losses if volatility widens too much in
your individual holdings. If more leaders emerge and the overall market

As the following examples show, your objective is to look for the stocks
that hold up the best—either declining the least or even moving somewhat
higher—during bear markets.

A Double-Edged Sword

Just as the leaders lead on the upside, they also lead on the downside. Why?
After  an  extended  rally  or  bull  market,  the  market’s  true  leaders  have
already made their big moves. The smart money that moved into those
stocks ahead of the curve will move out swiftly at the ﬁrst hint of slowing
growth. When the leading names in leading industry groups start to falter
after an extended market run, this is a danger signal that should heighten
your attention to the more speciﬁc signs of market trouble or possible trou-
ble in a particular sector.

Most stocks experience a relatively severe decline in price after a super-
performance phase has run its course. This is due to proﬁt taking and the
anticipation of slower growth ahead. Scientiﬁc evidence and my personal
experience indicate that the chances of a superperformer giving back most
or all of its gains are high. You must have a plan to sell and nail down prof-
its when you have them. History shows that one-third of superpeformers
give back all or more of their entire advance. On average, their subsequent
price declines are 50 to 70 percent, depending on the period measured.
In a post-bubble-type market such as 1929–1930s and 2000–2003, many
leading stocks declined as much as 80 to 90 percent. This is not the type of
decline from which a stock investor can recover. For those who do recover,
it generally takes 5 to 10 years or more.

Leaders Can Forecast Trouble Ahead

In the later stage of the general market’s advance, the same leaders will alert
you to weakness in their underlying sectors as well as potential upcoming
weakness in the broader market. Your portfolio will be your best barometer.
Your watch list of potential stock candidates should bring you into the mar-
ket early in the bullish phase as leading stocks set up and emerge into new
high ground. Later, you will be forced out of the market—stock by stock—
as many of the same issues start to churn, buckle, or accelerate their advance
over a number of weeks in a parabolic fashion ahead of the inevitable bear
phase or market correction. Leaders tend to top around the same time the

184

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

general market starts to show signs of distribution. It’s important to keep
your sights on the trees rather than on the forest.

Bull markets sometimes roll over gradually, whereas bottoms often
end with a sudden sell-off, followed by a strong rally. As the leaders start to
buckle, the indexes can move up farther or start to churn, moving sideways.
That occurs because cash stays in the market and rotates into laggard stocks.
The indexes hold up or even track higher on the backs of the stragglers.
Watch out! When this happens, the end is near and the really great opportu-
nities may have already passed.

Most investors miss these subtle signs, mainly because they become
conditioned by the market’s uptrend during the bullish phases. What’s the
big deal if a few stocks start to crack, they tell themselves, as long as the Dow
keeps heading higher, right? Wrong!

A bull market is always dominated by at least one sector and several
subsectors. Within the top sectors leading a new bull market, the relatively
few leading names that dominate the leadership during that market even-
tually attract the attention of institutional money. Buying enthusiasm for
those leaders can push their prices far above realistic valuations. As a result,
those issues tend to decline the most during the subsequent bear market.
For investors who hold on to the former leaders for too long, the results can
be devastating.

Investing in leading stocks is indeed very risky if it is timed incorrectly.
The highﬂiers are great when they’re going up; however, the downside can
be disastrous. If you don’t have a sensible exit plan to minimize losses, it is
certain that you will experience a major setback at some point. Big prof-
its can be made during periods of optimism. However, if you’re late to the
party, look out below. The same stocks that have been going up could be due
for a major correction.

For example, the technology stocks that led the 1998–2000 bull market
were the biggest losers during the 2000–2002 bear market and recovered at
best only about half of their losses during the entire 2003–2007 bull market.
History is littered with examples showing that the leaders of one bull market
are rarely the leaders of the next. Financials and housing stocks were market
leaders in the 2003–2007 bull market and then took the biggest losses dur-

C H A P T E R   9   F O L L O W   T H E   L E A D E R S

185

ing the bear decline in 2008. Therefore, if history is any guide, the leaders of
one cycle should generally be abandoned as buy candidates both for bear
market recovery rallies and for the next bull market. There is one caveat to
this: if the leadership stocks or sectors started to emerge near the end of the
bull market cycle preceding the subsequent bear market, in some cases they
can lead during the bull market. One thing for certain is that very often the
leaders of the next bull market will emerge from the most unlikely areas but
quickly reveal themselves through the application of the price analysis tech-
niques discussed in this chapter. Follow the leaders and you will participate
in and proﬁt from many of the most exciting entrepreneurial companies
this country has to offer.

Learn to Buy Leaders and Avoid Laggards

As a general rule, I buy strength, not weakness. True market leaders will
always show improving relative strength, in particular during a market cor-
rection. You should update your watch list on a frequent basis, weeding
out issues that give up too much price and adding through forced displace-
ment new potential buy candidates that show divergence and resilience. In
addition to keeping your lineup of candidate buys current, this practice will
sharpen your feel for the overall health and quality of the market and keep
you focused on the very best companies. Things begin to get exciting as the
broader market indexes start to bottom and begin the ﬁrst leg up in a new
bull market.

At this point, you should concentrate on the new 52-week-high list.
Many of the market’s biggest winners will be on the list in the early stages of
a new bull market. You should also keep an eye on stocks that held up well
during the market’s decline and are within striking distance (5 to 15 per-
cent) of a new 52-week high. Conversely, every day there is a list of stocks
to avoid printed in the ﬁnancial newspapers: the 52-week-low list. I suggest
that you stay away from this list and all of its components.

The 95 best-performing stocks of 1996 and 1997 took just ﬁve weeks to
surge 20 percent. On average, those stocks gained 421 percent. Among those
95 stocks, 21 jumped 20 percent within a mere week. Those stocks went on

186

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

to surge on average 484 percent. In 1999, many of the best stocks took just
one week to run up 20 percent; some did it in only three days. All of them
displayed superior relative strength before they advanced signiﬁcantly.

If the market is indeed bottoming, a growing number of stocks will dis-
play improving relative price strength while they go through a compara-
tively tight price correction. Generally, the correction for a healthy stock
from peak to low will be contained within 25 to 35 percent and during
severe bear market declines could be as much as 50 percent, but the less, the
better. A correction of more than 50 percent is generally too much, and a
stock could fail as it reaches or slightly surpasses a new high. This is due to
excessive overhead supply created by the steep price decline.

As the overall market is bottoming, your watch list should multiply
over a number of weeks. The better stocks start moving into new high
ground as the market rallies off its lows. This is a good sign that the mar-
ket has bottomed or is getting close to a bottom. This is a critical juncture.
Each emerging bull market tends to send up its unique set of leaders. The
leaders of the past bull market rarely lead the next rally, so expect to see
unfamiliar names. Fewer than 25 percent of market leaders in one cycle
generally lead the next cycle. It’s important to recognize the new crop of
top-performing companies and industries as early as possible. Remember
to listen to what the stocks are telling you, not the pundits. This will be your
best early-alert system.

Tune Out the Media

During a market decline the news is always ﬁlled with market gurus pre-
dicting the end of the world. Pessimism abounds. Inevitably, another group
of  so-called  experts  chime  in  that  the  bottom  may  be  near.  But  they’ll
announce that a real rally cannot take place without getting the nod from
their pet technical indicators. There is no shortage of elaborate theories
and technical indicators that people use to time the market. This deluge of
fear and conﬂicting advice can paralyze you on the cusp of a powerful rally.
Worse still, the media barrage could divert your attention from doing your
homework and concentrating on the facts if you let it.

C H A P T E R   9   F O L L O W   T H E   L E A D E R S

187

Shut off the TV, close out the media, and start looking for the next wave
of market leadership, which is certain to emerge eventually. Concentrate
on facts and follow the leaders. I assure you that new companies with new
products and new technologies will continue to emerge for as long as the
United States operates as a free enterprise system. History shows that with
each bull market, new leaders emerge and old ones step aside. Be ready to
act quickly; be prepared. Most important, tune out the media and tune in
the leaders.

A Picture Is Worth

a Million Dollars

Although the cheetah is the fastest animal in the world and can

catch any animal on the plains, it will wait until it is absolutely sure

it can catch its prey. It may hide in the bush for a week, waiting for

just the right moment. It will wait for a baby antelope, and not just

any baby antelope, but preferably one that is also sick or lame; only

then, when there is no chance it can lose its prey, does it attack.

That, to me, is the epitome of professional trading.

—Mark Weinstein

P roponents of the efﬁcient market hypothesis (EMH), which

was  developed  by  Professor  Eugene  Fama  at  the  University  of
Chicago Booth School of Business in the early 1960s, consider the stock
market to be perfectly priced—or at least nearly perfectly priced—to the
extent that the market is “informationally efﬁcient.” In other words, it is
theorized that stock prices already reﬂect all known information and that
the markets adjust so rapidly to reﬂect new information that there is no
advantage in having it. Therefore, according to EMH, it is impossible to
outperform the market by using data that the “market” already knows about
except through luck. Defenders of this theory scoff at the notion that price
and volume analysis can give an investor a winning edge. Needless to say, I

189

190

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

disagree; my career and those of many other traders I know have demon-
strated that EMH is a ﬂawed theory. Most of those who subscribe to EMH
have never made a living from stock trading, let alone achieved superper-
formance. Perhaps EMH makes sense to those who cannot outperform the
market; since they cannot do it, they believe it’s impossible. Highly success-
ful traders know otherwise.

Ultimately,  it’s  people—emotional,  imperfect,  even  illogical—who
make buy and sell decisions. Ego, fear, greed, hope, ignorance, incompe-
tence, overreaction, and a host of other human errors in reasoning and judg-
ment create all sorts of discrepancies and in turn opportunity. An invaluable
tool to use to discern those opportunities is charting the fundamental battle
between supply and demand. Charts enable us to see what’s going on in a
particular stock as buyers and sellers come together in an auction market-
place. They distill the clash for emotional, logical, and even manipulative
decisions into a clear visual display; the verdict of supply and demand. If
you look at charts in this way, you will appreciate how these images depict
all the choices people are making, whether to buy or to sell. In one glance
you can see precisely what took place in a particular time frame.

There is nothing new under the sun in regard to charting and using
graphs. People have been using charts for centuries. Think of the ship cap-
tains who charted the stars for navigation. In a similar way, we use charts to
navigate the market. Many investors try to read charts, but few know how
to do it correctly. As I pointed out earlier, the argument some people make
against charts is that past information cannot be predictive. If you were to
utilize that philosophy in life, however, you would never be able to judge a
current event by using the evidence of the past: what a drop in barometric
pressure signals about the weather or that a 103-degree fever and body aches
are symptoms of the ﬂu.

Some people believe that you cannot time the market or time stock
trades  very  effectively,  that  attempting  to  do  so  is  a  fruitless  endeavor
regardless of your techniques or available information. I can tell you from
experience that I owe much of my success to the precision of my timing,
which would be virtually impossible without the use of charts. Many of the

191

best money managers use charts. My own trading relies on charting to the
extent that I would never bet on my fundamental ideas alone without con-
ﬁrmation from the actual price action of the underlying stock. First, I uti-
lize charts to establish the prevailing trend of a stock’s price. In other words,
technical analysis enables me to qualify candidates for my watch list. Then I
use charts to time the entry of my trades.

Can Charts Help You Achieve
Superperformance?

Can charts empower you to predict the market? Of course not. You can’t
predict the market any more than you can predict where the ball will drop
during the next spin of a roulette wheel. Fortunately, to succeed at stock
trading, you don’t have to predict the market any more than a casino needs
to know in advance the outcome of each individual spin of its roulette
wheel or each hand at its blackjack tables to make money from its gam-
ing operations. Those who think it’s necessary to predict stock prices to be
successful are missing the whole point. Savvy traders use price and volume
analysis as a mechanism to time their trades, manage risk, and increase the
probabilities for proﬁt. Many of the most successful traders know ﬁrsthand
the value of charting stocks. Their success has nothing to do with predic-
tion or forecasting; rather, they rely on the acquired skill of reading the
footprints of the market and then expose their capital to high reward-to-
risk opportunities.

Use Charts as a Tool

Broadly speaking, there are three schools of thought about the art of chart-
ing  stocks,  also  referred  to  as  technical  analysis.  The  ﬁrst  is  the  purest
method, relying only on the price and volume action. Pure stock market
technicians believe that everything you need to know is in the chart; they
essentially regard fundamentals as unnecessary information that is ulti-
mately “discounted,” that is, reﬂected in a stock’s share price. At the other

192

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

end of the spectrum is the second group: pure fundamentalists who believe
that everything you need to know lies in a company’s fundamentals. To
them, squiggly lines, candlesticks, and point-and-ﬁgure boxes are irrelevant.
These number crunchers disdain chart analysis as something akin to read-
ing tea leaves.

The third group consists of techno-fundamentalists. As the name sug-
gests, these traders exploit both technical analysis and fundamental analysis.
If I had to pick, I would put myself in this group. I rely on price and volume
as well as fundamentals. In making the decision whether to purchase a stock,
there are important characteristics to consider, both fundamental and tech-
nical. A healthy hybrid approach exploits charts as well as fundamentals to
increase the trader’s odds of success.

The Effect, Not the Cause

Many of the basic chart patterns were discovered in the pre-Depression era,
in the early 1900s. You might well ask, Assuming that these trading pat-
terns were effective in the remote past, might they have become so popular
or readily available that they should have ceased to bestow an edge many
years ago? The answer is simple: Chart patterns are not the cause; they’re
the effect. The supply and demand picture does not dictate to the mar-
ket; human behavior does, and human behavior hasn’t changed and isn’t
likely to change much in the future. Thus, chart patterns remain powerful
tools in timing trade entries and exits.

Today, more information moves faster than ever and trades can be
placed in an instant with a click of a mouse. However, that has not changed
basic human nature. The charting techniques I explain in this chapter, like
everything in this book, are based on what I do in my own trading: my daily
work, the product of 30 years of learning, application, reﬁnement, and per-
sonal success in the stock market. Not only are these techniques applicable
today, historical studies have shown that the techniques I used during my
own career would have been effective many decades before my lifetime. For
example, let’s time-travel back to 1927, when RCA was the AOL of its era,
advancing 721 percent in 18 months, or to 1934, when Coca-Cola emerged

C H A P T E R   1 0   A   P I C T U R E   I S   W O R T H   A   M I L L I O N   D O L L A R S

193

as a market leader several months before the general market bottomed and
then advanced 580 percent. The clues leading up to their phenomenal per-
formance were no different from what occurs in a modern time frame. So,
then, are price patterns timeless?

I have dedicated most of my life to the study of superperformance
investing, and I can tell you that the same elementary forces of hope and
greed, exuberance and panic, that formed the observable price behavior of
Microsoft and America Online in the 1990s showed up in the price move-
ments of market leaders decades before that period. Stock prices move
in virtually the same fashion today that they followed in the past. That’s
observed fact, not opinion. For an investor who is willing to commit the
time to become educated, charts are a valuable tool, along with fundamen-

tal analysis. Bringing all the tools in your tool kit together allows you to use
them in a synergistic way in your pursuit of superperformance.

Is the Train on Schedule?

Over the years, people would walk into my ofﬁce, look at my computer
monitors, and ask, “How do you know what all those lines mean? They look
so confusing.” The answer is that you have to know what you’re looking for.
When I go into the doctor’s ofﬁce and get an EKG, I have no idea what the
lines bouncing up and down on the little strip of paper printouts mean. But
to a trained professional, this simple procedure of charting the activity and
rhythm of a person’s heart can provide valuable information on whether the
heart is acting normally or abnormally. Similarly, in examining a graph of a
stock’s price and volume, we are looking to see if it is acting normally or giv-
ing us reason for concern. Therefore, charts provide valuable clues as well as
speciﬁc information.

Price and volume analysis can help you determine whether a stock is
under accumulation or distribution (being bought or sold in size). It can
alert an astute chart reader to extreme danger, and it can also indicate when
the odds of a potentially proﬁtable situation are relatively high. But only a
small number of people who look at charts use them effectively, and only
a small percentage know what to focus on to produce really outstanding
results. The ultimate fundamental in any auction marketplace is the law
of supply and demand. If you learn how to differentiate constructive from
faulty price action, you can use charts as a ﬁlter to screen your investment
candidates to ﬁnd the best possible selections and improve your odds of suc-
cess. The key is not knowing for sure what a stock is going to do next but
knowing what it should do. Then it’s a matter of determining whether the
proverbial train is on schedule.

Suppose you take the 6:05 train to work each morning. It generally
arrives at the station somewhere between 6:00 and 6:10. But today, you look
down at your watch and see that it is 6:15 and the train has still not arrived.
You don’t think much about it and probably say to yourself that the train is
just running a little late. What happens at seven o’clock if the train has still

C H A P T E R   1 0   A   P I C T U R E   I S   W O R T H   A   M I L L I O N   D O L L A R S

195

not pulled into the station? You are most likely going to think that maybe
something is wrong with the train; the more time that elapses, the higher the
probability that something has gone wrong. The only reason you can make
this educated guess is that you have knowledge of what is normal and what
should happen.

When one identiﬁes the proper characteristics for a superperformance
candidate, the risks become unambiguous. If a stock doesn’t act as expected,
that’s a major red ﬂag. After all, the stock has already met very elite criteria
and has been deemed a strong prospect. If such a stock behaves poorly, that
suggests a problem. Learning what to expect allows you to detect when a
stock is acting correctly or incorrectly in the prevailing conditions. Because
you know how something is supposed to perform, when it doesn’t perform
that way, it makes the exit decision much easier.

First Things First

The ﬁrst mistake I see amateurs make time and again when using charts is
ignoring the ﬁrst step: the big picture. The ﬁrst and most basic information
that charts show us is the prevailing trend of a stock. We can see if it’s trend-
ing up or down or is moving in a sideways pattern (i.e., stage 1, 2, 3, or 4).
Once we have established that the longer-term trend is up (stage 2) and see
some evidence that a particular name is a candidate deserving of our atten-
tion, whether it’s a market leader, a turnaround situation, or even a cyclical,
it’s time to concern ourselves with the best time to purchase the stock. At
that point, we want to determine when the moment is right to pull the trig-
ger and make our commitment to the position. Therefore, charting can play
an important role in selection and timing.

My ﬁrst advice about charting stocks is that you should not look at
things in a vacuum. Most of the chart work I rely on is based on the contin-
uation of an existing trend. This concept is fundamental to my approach.
If you want to maximize compounding, you want to be where the action
is and take advantage of momentum. You should limit your selections
to those stocks displaying evidence of being supported by institutional
buying. You’re not trying to be the ﬁrst one on board; rather, you’re

196

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

looking for where momentum is picking up and the risk of failure is rel-
atively low. To time my entry, I look for price consolidations, which are
momentary pauses or periods of rest within the context of a prior uptrend.
However, too often an investor will buy a stock because it has a “great”
chart base but will overlook the fact that the base is within the context of a
long-term downtrend.

Going long a “great base” in a long-term downtrend is like saying you’re
in good health by focusing on your low cholesterol reading when you have
pneumonia. Although the cholesterol reading is good, you face a much
more serious problem. The current chart pattern is only as good as where
it resides within the context of its longer-term trend. If you are too early,
you run the risk of the stock resuming its downtrend. If you’re too late,
you run the risk of buying a late-stage base that is obvious to everyone and
prone to failure. Time the trade correctly, though, and you could be on the
way to a very sizable gain.

I  never go against  the  long-term  trend. I look to go long a stage 2
uptrend and go short a stage 4 downtrend, plain and simple. To be con-
sistent and stack the probabilities in your favor, you need to operate in a
systematic fashion. The step-by-step approach I’m showing you here is a
process. The ﬁrst part of that process is to qualify the current chart pattern
by ﬁltering stocks on the basis of the prevailing trend and then buying them
as they emerge from their consolidation periods before they become too
widely followed and obvious. However, the current chart pattern must be
put into context. If the long-term trend is not up, the stock simply doesn’t
qualify as a candidate for purchase. Therefore, don’t forget the big picture.
As the saying goes, the trend is your friend. If you try to trade against it, the
trend becomes your worst enemy. To increase your odds of success, stick
to stocks moving in a deﬁnite uptrend. If a stock’s price is in a long-term
downtrend, don’t even consider buying it.

Look for Consolidation Periods

Once you have identiﬁed a stage 2 uptrend, the next step is to look for the
conditions that facilitate a sustainable move higher: a proper base. Notice

that I said a proper base, not just any base. Anyone can look at a chart and
identify a stock that is moving sideways. It takes more than that; you need
to know precisely what to look for. A constructive price consolidation phase
starts as a period of rest or digestion during which the previous movement
in the stock is met with temporary proﬁt taking, which leads to an equilib-
rium or correction mode. The better stock selections generally will correct
the least amount percentagewise from absolute peak to trough during their
correction phase. Stocks that are under accumulation will rest and consoli-
date within the context of a long-term uptrend and then continue higher.
Most of these situations will show telltale signs. Depending on the particular
footprint of the price action over 3 to as many as 60 weeks of price history,
there are various nuances that will allow you to make an educated decision
about whether the stock should be bought or sold.

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

The Volatility Contraction Pattern

Most investors cannot resist the urge to buy stocks at the wrong time, usu-
ally when the price is declining. I’m constantly asked whether I like this
stock or that stock, and 99 percent of the time my reply is, “I wouldn’t buy
it here.” The reason for this is that I have a strict discipline that only allows
me to buy at a very speciﬁc point: the point at which reward outweighs risk.
How do I identify this point?

If there is any one commonality or Holy Grail that I follow and practice
regularly, it is the concept of volatility contraction. This is a key distinction
that I look for in almost every trade. A common characteristic of virtu-
ally all constructive price structures (those under accumulation) is a con-
traction of volatility accompanied by speciﬁc areas in the base structure
where volume contracts signiﬁcantly. I use the volatility contraction pattern
(VCP) concept to illustrate this.

For our purposes here, VCP is part of the supply and demand setup.
The main role that VCP plays is establishing a precise entry point at the line
of least resistance. In virtually all the chart patterns I rely on, I’m looking for
volatility to contract from left to right. I want to see the stock move from
greater volatility on the left side of the price base to lesser volatility on the
right side.

The Contraction Count

In February 1995, I purchased FSI International (FSII), which was emerging
out of a cup-with-handle pattern. The stock displayed perfect VCP charac-
teristics in a clear stage 2 uptrend. The consolidation period lasted 10 weeks,
corrected 18 percent in the cup, and contracted to just 5 percent in the han-
dle area. Note the volume contraction during the tightest portion of the
setup on the far right side of the base. I bought the stock as it broke above
the high in the handle during week 11. The stock advanced 130 percent from
that point.

During a VCP, you will generally see a succession of anywhere from two
to six contractions, with the stock coming off initially by, say, 25 percent
from its absolute high to its low. Then the stock rallies a bit, and then it sells

off 15 percent. Then buyers come back in, and the price goes up some more,
and ﬁnally it retreats 8 percent. The progressive reduction in price volatility,
which will be accompanied by a reduction in volume at particular points,
eventually signiﬁes that the base has been completed.

As a rule of thumb, I like to see each successive contraction contained
to about half (plus or minus a reasonable amount) of the previous pullback
or contraction. The volatility, measured from high to low, will be greatest
when sellers rush to take proﬁts. When sellers become scarcer, the price cor-
rection will not be as dramatic, and volatility will decrease. Typically, most
VCP setups will be formed by two to four contractions, although sometimes
there can be as many as ﬁve or six. This action will produce a pattern, which
also reveals the symmetry of the contractions being formed. I call these con-
tractions Ts.

Not all price patterns display VCP characteristics. There are some varia-
tions, such as the square-shaped Darvas box pattern, or a ﬂat base structure

that is four to seven weeks in duration. With this type of base, there is no real
volatility contraction as it remains a tight and narrow pattern or box, mov-
ing in a sideways range with about a 10 to 15 percent correction from high
point to low point. Or a stock could undergo successive consolidations, with
varying degrees of volatility to produce contractions, for example, from a 25
percent correction, to a 10 percent, to a 5 percent, and so forth, which would
be indicative of a classic VCP progression.

The Technical Footprint

Each stock makes its own unique mark as it goes through a consolidation
period. Similar to a ﬁngerprint, they look alike from afar, but when you zoom
in, no two are identical. The resulting signature is what I call the stock’s tech-
nical footprint. The immediate distinguishing features of the VCP will be
the number of contractions that are formed (typically between two and
four), their relative depths throughout the base, and the level of trading
volume associated with speciﬁc points within the structure. Because I track
hundreds of names each week, I created a quick way to capture a visual of a
stock by quickly reviewing my nightly notes and each stock’s footprint abbre-
viation. This quick reference is made up of three components:

1.  Time. How many days or weeks have passed since the base started?

2.  Price. How deep was the largest correction, and how narrow was

the smallest pullback at the very right of the price base?

3.  Symmetry. How many contractions (Ts) did the stock go through

during the basing process?

In the same way you could get a mental picture of a man if I told you
he was 6 feet tall, weighed 230 pounds, and had a 43-inch waist, knowing
a stock’s “measurements” gives me a visual of its footprint and helps me
understand certain key aspects of the price base even without looking at
the chart. Let’s take a look at Meridian Bioscience (VIVO), which in the
middle of a stage 2 uptrend built a series of volatility contractions as it con-
solidated before continuing its upward run. Meridian Bioscience contracted
four times (a 4T) before it emerged out of its 40-week (40W) consolidation
and advanced more than 100 percent over the next 15 months.

The following chart shows four periods of volatility contraction within
the base that are framed by the dotted lines. The ﬁrst period started in April
2006, when the stock declined from $19 a share to $13, correcting 31 percent
from high to low. The stock then moved higher and consolidated again, fall-
ing from just under $17 to below $14 a share for a 17 percent pullback. This
is the ﬁrst sign of contracting volatility. After the second pullback, the stock

Figure 10.6  The VCP footprint with abbreviation: 40W 31/3 4T

rallied once again, this time to just above $17 a share, and then it pulled back
to below $16, a much tighter price range of about 8 percent. At this point, I
began getting interested in the stock.

Finally, a short and narrow pullback of just 3 percent over two weeks
on very low volume formed the pivot buy point. This told me that selling

203

activity had dried up. Proﬁt taking had exhausted itself as incremental sup-
ply coming to market had abated. After putting in four Ts with successive
decreases in price volatility and volume, the stock price was primed to spike
if buyers came demanding inventory. In January 2007, I jumped on board
as Median Bioscience cracked above the pivot buy point at $18 a share on a
noticeable increase in volume; it proceeded to advance 118 percent over the
next 15 months.

What Does Volatility Contraction Tell Us?

If a stock is under accumulation, a price consolidation represents a period
when  strong  investors  ultimately  absorb  weak  traders.  Once  the “weak
hands” have been eliminated, the lack of supply allows the stock to move
higher because even a small amount of demand will overwhelm the negli-
gible inventory. This is referred to as the line of least resistance. Tightness
in price from absolute highs to lows and tight closes with little change in
price from one day to the next and also from one week to the next are gen-
erally constructive. These tight areas should be accompanied by a signiﬁ-
cant decrease in trading volume. In some instances, volume dries up at or
near the lowest levels established since the beginning of the stock’s advance.
This is a very positive development, especially if it takes place after a period
of correction and consolidation, and is a telltale sign that the amount of
stock coming to market has diminished. A stock that is under accumulation
will almost always show these characteristics (tightness in price with volume
contracting). This is what you want to see before you initiate your purchase
on the right side of the base, which forms what we call the pivot buy point.
Speciﬁcally, the point at which you want to buy is when the stock moves
above the pivot point on expanding volume.

This is a vital concept for successfully timing the continuation of an
existing trend. For the best situations, during this contraction in volatility,
volume will also contract during speciﬁc points that can be identiﬁed time
and again.

I came up with the VCP concept because I saw so many people rely on
patterns that seemed to trace out the general appearance of a constructive

204

price base, but those people missed some of the most important elements of
the structure, which can make it invalid and prone to failure. I can assure
you that almost every failed base structure that you experience can be
traced back to some faulty characteristic that was overlooked. Many books
superﬁcially describe technical patterns. Pattern recognition exercises will
often lead you astray if you lack an understanding of the supply and demand
forces that give rise to high-probability setups as opposed to head fakes. Let’s
look a little more deeply at the nature and forces of supply and demand to
understand what is actually taking place.

Detecting Overhead Supply

As a stock corrects and heads lower, inevitably there are trapped buyers who
bought around the stock’s previous high point and are now sitting with a
loss; trapped buyers agonize over their deepening paper losses and, sweat-
ing bullets, look for a rally to sell. As their losses grow and more time passes,

C H A P T E R   1 0   A   P I C T U R E   I S   W O R T H   A   M I L L I O N   D O L L A R S

205

many of these buyers would be delighted just to get even. This is what cre-
ates overhead supply: investors who want out around their breakeven point;
they can’t wait to sell and assuage their egos by thinking that despite the
roller-coaster ordeal, they “got out even.”

Adding to the supply issue is another group of buyers who, unlike the
trapped buyers sitting at a loss and waiting to break even, were fortunate
enough to bottom ﬁsh the stock and now are accumulating very nice prof-
its. As the stock trades back up near its old high, as the trapped buyers are
getting even, the proﬁt takers also feel the urge to sell and nail down a quick
buck. All this selling creates a price pullback on the right side of the base.
If the stock is indeed being accumulated by institutions, the contractions
will be smaller from left to right as supply is absorbed by the bigger players.
When a stock traces out a VCP and undergoes a series of contractions, it is
simply the law of supply and demand at work, an indication that the stock is
changing hands in an orderly manner. You should wait until the stock goes

Figure 10.8  Theoretical example of supply/demand dynamics

supply has stopped coming to market and the line of least resistance has been
established.

206

through a normal process of shares changing hands from weak holders to
strong ones. As a trader using a stop loss, you are a weak holder. The key
is to be the last weak holder; you want the other weak holders to exit the
stock before you buy.

Evidence that supply has stopped coming to market is revealed as the
trading volume contracts signiﬁcantly and price action quiets down notice-
ably. Demanding this attribute will help you avoid a crowded trade, improv-
ing the likelihood that the stock is off the public’s radar, which increases
the odds of success. If the stock’s price and volume don’t quiet down on
the right side of the consolidation, chances are that supply is still coming to
market and the stock is too risky.

Why Buy Near a New High?

One of the most common phrases you hear in the stock market is “buy low
and sell high.” These words have become synonymous with the way most
people think about how to make money in stocks. Of course, it’s obvious
that you have to buy at a price lower than the price at which you sell to make
a proﬁt. However, this does not mean that you have to buy at or near the
lowest price at which a stock has traded historically. Markets are far more
often correct than are personal opinions or even expert forecasts. A stock
making a new 52-week high during the early stages of a fresh bull mar-
ket could be a stellar performer in its infancy. In contrast, a stock near its
52-week low at best has overhead supply to work through and lacks upside
momentum; worse still, such a stock may be headed for a series of lower
lows. A stock hitting a new high has no overhead supply to contend with.
The stock is saying, “Hey, I have something going on here, and people are
taking notice,” whereas a stock hitting a new low is clearly a laggard that
lacks investor interest or is being dumped in size by institutions.

 There are those of you who say, “I don’t want to wait until the stage
2 criteria are conﬁrmed.” You want to try to get in early, when the stock is
moving off its lows. The problem here is that there is no conﬁrmation in the
early stages. How do you know that the stock is attracting institutions? Even

C H A P T E R   1 0   A   P I C T U R E   I S   W O R T H   A   M I L L I O N   D O L L A R S

207

a good start can get derailed if the fundamentals aren’t really there, and you
end up buying a bounce that ﬁzzles and the stock stays in stage 1 limbo or,
worse, breaks down and declines.

When a stock reaches a new high in a conﬁrmed stage 2 uptrend sup-
ported by big volume clues, it has been propelled upward by institutions
taking positions because they believe that the fundamentals are solid and the
prospects for the future are even better. In the following examples you can
see how the real excitement doesn’t even start until these stocks are hitting
all-time price highs.

The only way a stock can become a superperformer, moving from, say,
$20 to $80, is for that stock to make a series of new highs repeatedly, all the
way up. The same thing applies to a stock that’s at $50 and doubles to $100
on its way to $300. Monster Beverage (MNST) registered an all-time high in
late 2003. If you were afraid to buy the stock because it appeared too high,
you would have missed a huge opportunity; the stock price advanced 8,000
percent by early 2006.

Deep Correction Patterns
Are Failure-Prone

When a stock declines precipitously, it is likely that there is a serious prob-
lem in the company, its industry, or perhaps a bear market is unfolding. You
shouldn’t conclude that a stock is a bargain just because it’s trading down 50
or 60 percent off its high. First, such a decline could indicate that a serious
fundamental problem is undermining the share price. Second, even if the
fundamentals are not problematic yet, a stock that has experienced a deep
sell-off must contend with a large amount of overhead supply: the more a
stock drops, the more it is burdened by trapped buyers. Finally, the more a
stock declines, the more potential proﬁt takers will be waiting to sell if the
stock rallies and intersects overhead supply; the larger the proﬁt is, the more
likely it is that bottom feeders will sell. During major bear market correc-

tions, some names can decline by as much as 50 percent and still work out.
I rarely buy a stock that has corrected 60 percent or more; a stock that is
down that much often signals a serious problem. Most constructive set-
ups correct between 10 percent and 35 percent. You will have more success
if you concentrate on stocks that correct the least versus the ones that cor-
rect the most. Under most conditions, stocks that correct more than two or
three times the decline of the general market should be avoided.

Time Compression

If a stock advances too quickly up the right side, this forms a hazardous
time compression, and in most cases the stock should be avoided, at least
temporarily. Time compression will show up as V-shaped price action or
the absence of proper right-side development. Constructive price consoli-

212

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

dations tend to have a degree of symmetry; a buildup of supply takes time
to digest and work through. A quick up-and-down gyration doesn’t give
the stock enough time to weed out the weak holders; it takes time for the
strong hands to relieve the weaker players. You want to give your stock
enough time to undergo a constructive consolidation period, which will
allow it to continue its primary advance unencumbered by the chains of
immediate sellers.

Depending on the depth of the correction, a proper basing period can
last anywhere from 3 weeks to as long as 65 weeks. By demanding that the
price action display VCP characteristics, you will increase your chances of
identifying a stock in which supply is diminishing and a sound point for
entry is developing, which will lead to an immediate and sustained advance.

Shakeouts

In addition to contracting volatility and the absence of time compression,
we are looking for price shakeouts within the base structure. Most of us have
been on the wrong side of a shakeout at one time or another. Let’s say you
bought a stock at $40 a share. You noticed that over the past several months
it had traded several times as low as $35 a share before bouncing higher. It
stood to reason that this was an area of support and that placing a protec-
tive stop just below that level would be logical. The problem, however, is
that you were not the only one who made that observation. Always include
in your thinking that whatever you’re seeing in the marketplace is also
visible to everyone else. Most likely, other traders thought it was obvious
to put a stop somewhere under $35 a share. In the stock market, what is too
obvious seldom works. Shortly after you purchased the stock at $40, it sold
off, and this time it dropped below $35. Sell stops were hit, and that sent the

214

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

price even lower. You were knocked out of your position, as was everyone
else who had a stop just below $35. Once that selling was exhausted, the
stock turned around and rallied higher, only you weren’t on board. Sound
familiar? You were the victim of a price shakeout.

To improve your odds, you want to see one or more price shakeouts
at certain key points during the base-building period. This will also allow
for the elimination of weak holders and allow a sustained move higher.
Remember, as a disciplined stock trader using stop losses to control risk,
you, too, are a weak holder. In other words, you will sell during a relatively
minor price pullback to protect yourself against the possibility of a larger
loss. This is not to delegitimize your stop-loss discipline. A stop-loss regime
is essential. Inevitably, however, good stop-loss practice will shake you out
of some winning stocks. To the extent that you identify base formations that
have exhibited and digested shakeouts before your entry, you are less likely
to be thrown from the saddle.

Figure 10.17  Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS) 2003

creating a shakeout.

215

Informed investors who understand price action are on the lookout for
evidence of price shakeouts within the base before they buy. Price shakeouts
will strengthen the setup at the completion of the base. Major support areas
are obvious to amateurs and therefore should be obvious traps to profes-
sionals. Like a mineﬁeld, they’re ﬁlled with stops, ready to blow when the
share price brushes the trip wire. It’s beyond the purview of this book, but
there are professional traders who are expert at picking off the amateurs
when obvious support areas are breached and trigger the amateurs’ stand-
ing orders.

Don’t get confused; what you may think is just a shakeout is not the
time to buy a declining stock. We are not forecasters; we are interpreters.
When a stock that is seemingly in the process of building a base undercuts
a support ﬂoor, it may be a price shakeout, or the stock could be entering
a precipitous or sustained decline. This is why you wait to see if it results
in a shakeout. Ideally, you want to see this occur one, two, or three times,

depending on the size and magnitude of the price base, before you enter the
trade. Shakeouts can occur at the lows of a base, on the right side, and in the
handle or pivot area.

Look for Evidence of  Demand

So far we have taken an aerial view to identify candidates that meet our crite-
ria on the basis of the footprint formed by their price action. At this point in
our analysis, we have already determined that a stock is in a stage 2 uptrend.
As that previous uptrend is digested, people will sell and take proﬁts; there-
fore, we will look for some correction to occur. When that selling occurs,
there will be some people who wish they had taken a proﬁt but did not.
When the stock moves up again, they will seize the next opportunity to get
out. What we want to see is what comes next. After the selling has slowed, is

C H A P T E R   1 0   A   P I C T U R E   I S   W O R T H   A   M I L L I O N   D O L L A R S

217

there still an appetite for the stock? Will big demand come in after a sell-off
to propel the stock even higher? Or is the move over? By closely observing
price and volume action, we can gain this insight.

At this point, we want to zoom in and look for signs of institutional
accumulation. A sign of accumulation is a spike up in price. Price spikes
generally occur off the lows of a correction within the base and on the right
side of the base; this kind of price action gains credence if it is accompanied
by outsized volume. A spike in price on overwhelming volume often indi-
cates institutional buying, which is exactly what we’re looking for. After
a price shakeout, it’s a good sign if the stock rallies back on big volume.

A stock may experience big price spikes in the form of gaps. A price gap
occurs when the share price prints at a wide increment above or below the
previous print; this is most easily observable at the open, but in thinly traded
stocks it can also occur intraday. Gaps often occur on big volume. Upward
price gaps may result from positive news such as better than expected earn-
ings, a favorable industry development, or a brokerage house upgrade.
Ideally, the gap will result from a fundamental change that creates a positive
shift in perception and generates buying demand. In many cases, a price gap
will show up on a weekly graph as well. What you’re trying to determine is
whether the stock is under accumulation by large institutional buyers.

The next chart shows Meridian Bioscience (VIVO) as the stock price
initially came down and put in a low in May, a level that was undercut in
July; after that, the stock came roaring back, followed by a short-term pull-
back and then a big gap to the upside. Accompanying that gap was a surge
of volume, reﬂecting strong demand. A sideways pattern developed dur-
ing October, with a sell-off that took out the September low, triggering
another price shakeout. Notice how the overall price structure is beginning
to tighten up. The combination of the big demand (gap) days, low-volume
pullbacks, several price shakeouts within the base, and a contraction in price
provided sufﬁcient evidence that this stock was under accumulation. Even
as the stock tightened up and formed the handle area in December, it under-
went two minor price shakeouts, adding even more strength to the setup.
Keep in mind that one aspect alone did not make for a great trade setup.
Rather, it was a combination of all these factors.

Figure 10.20  Meridian Bioscience (VIVO) 2007
Meridian Bioscience displayed strong demand off the lows before tightening up
constructively on the right side.

A big price spike on a surge of volume indicates that institutions are
buying in size. At the same time, you’ll want to see a dearth of down spikes.
In other words, the volume must be much bigger on up days than on down
days, and a few of the price spikes to the upside should be large, dwarﬁng the
contractions that have occurred on relatively lower volume.

After undercutting the December low, the stock price of Dick’s Sporting
Goods came roaring back on big volume. Note the price gap that occurred
in February with the biggest volume since the company’s initial public
offering (IPO). In and of itself, this action was an insufﬁcient reason to buy
because the stock had yet to go through the process of putting in a VCP.
Later, however, once the VCP was completed, the stock was set up properly
as a buy candidate; it soon broke out and went on to advance 525 percent in
54 months.

Look for signiﬁcant, above-average increases in volume on upward
moves  coming  off  the  lows  and  up  the  right  side  of  the  base.  It’s  not
uncommon to see a surge of several hundred percent or even as much as
1,000 percent compared with the average volume. Look for big up days
that are larger and occur more frequently than big down days. Avoid a
stock that follows a big demand day with even bigger down days on vol-
ume. Large up days and weeks on increased overall volume, contrasted
with lower-volume pullbacks, are another constructive sign that the stock
you are considering is under institutional accumulation. Look for these
traits before you buy.

Price Spikes Preceding a Consolidation

Often a price spike will occur on the left side just before a price correc-
tion or consolidation begins. This may come on news and cause the stock
to become extended and prone to a pullback, particularly if the overall
market begins correcting. Cirrus Logic raised its earnings guidance by
forecasting better than expected numbers for the upcoming quarter. This
caused the stock to shoot up dramatically. Within days of the price spike,
the overall market started correcting. This put temporary pressure on
Cirrus’s stock price, causing it to correct 23 percent off its high, which
was an acceptable 2.3 times the market correction. Once the market bot-
tomed, the stock price moved up the right side and set up constructively.
Cirrus advanced +162 percent in just four months from the point at which
it made a new 52-week high.

The Pivot Point

A proper pivot point represents the completion of a stock’s consolidation
and the cusp of its next advance. In other words, after a base pattern has
been established, the pivot point is where the stock establishes a price level
that will act as the trigger to enter that trade. Now the stock has moved into
position for purchase. As the stock’s price trades above the high of the pivot,
this often represents the start of the next advancing phase. A pivot point is
a “call to action” price level. It is often referred to as the optimal buy point.
A pivot point can occur in connection with a stock breaking into new high
territory or below the stock’s high.

In the context of a stock’s consolidation, a temporary pause allows you
to set a price trigger to enter a trade. For example, a trader might put in a

limit order to buy 1,000 shares if the price breaks the upper level of the pivot

224

point. You want to buy as close to the pivot point as possible without chas-
ing the stock up more than a few percentage points.

Jesse Livermore described the pivot point as the line of least resistance.
A stock can move very fast once it crosses this threshold. When a stock
breaks through the line of least resistance, the chances are the greatest
that it will move higher in a short period of time. This is the case because
this point represents an area where supply is low; therefore, even a small
amount of demand can move the stock higher. Rarely does a correct pivot
point fail coming out of a sound consolidation.

The  next  chart  shows  Mercadolibre  (MELI),  which  has  a  technical
footprint of 6W 32/6 3T, meaning that the basing period occurred over six
weeks, with corrections that began at 32 percent and concluded at 6 percent
at the pivot. In November, the stock underwent a price shakeout and pro-
ceeded to tighten up in a constructive fashion. Notice, too, how the last con-
traction was accompanied with little volume as a dearth of stock changed

hands during the last (T) pivot point. After charging through the pivot
point, Mercadolibre’s stock price rose 75 percent in just 13 days. This is the
type of rapid price escalation I’m interested in being part of.

Volume at the Pivot Point
Every correct pivot point will develop with a contraction in volume, often to
a level well below average with at least one day when volume contracts very
signiﬁcantly, in many cases to almost nothing or near the lowest volume
level in the entire base structure. In fact, we want to see volume on the ﬁnal
contraction that is below the 50-day average, with one or two days when vol-
ume is extremely low. This may not always occur in the largest-cap stocks,
but in some of the smaller issues, volume will dry up to a trickle; viewed as a
lack of liquidity, this worries many investors. However, this is precisely what
occurs right before a stock is ready to make a big move. Why? Because the

decreased volume means that stock has stopped coming to market. With
very little supply of stock in the market from sellers, even a small amount of
buying can move the price up very rapidly.

During the tightest section of the consolidation (the pivot point), vol-
ume should contract signiﬁcantly. Consider the example of New Oriental
Education. First, take note of the footprint: 8W 22/2 3T, indicating an
eight-week base with successively tighter pullbacks of 22 percent, 8 per-
cent, and then 2 percent. Not only is the last contraction tight in terms
of price (a 2 percent ﬂuctuation), volume dries up considerably as well.
The pivot point that forms is very tight with volume that is dramatically
lower than the average. This is a very constructive sign. Now, just as the
price breaks above the pivot on increasing volume, that’s where you want
to place your buy order. New Oriental Education advanced 105 percent in
seven months from the pivot point.

Extrapolating Volume Intraday
After the last narrow contraction in a VCP pattern on light volume, ide-
ally you want to see an upward move in the making on stronger than usual
volume. Let’s say that a stock normally trades 1 million shares. Two hours
into the trading day, 500,000 shares—half the usual volume—has already
exchanged hands and the stock is moving up. You still have four and a half
hours to go. Therefore, you can comfortably extrapolate that on the basis of
the intraday volume thus far, the volume for the day could easily be 300 to
400 percent (or more) of the average daily volume. Now, when the price goes
through the pivot point, you can place your trade.

Always Wait for the Stock to Pivot
Some investors will try to get in before the breach of the pivot point to save
a few pennies on the trade. Assuming that a stock will break out is danger-
ous. If the pivot point is tight, there is no material advantage in getting
in early; you will accomplish little except to take on unnecessary risk. Let
the stock break above the pivot and prove itself. The pivot point is only
one part of the overall setup, but it’s the most important piece of the puzzle
before I buy a stock, because it is the ﬁnal determinant of when I’m going to
pull the trigger and risk my capital.

Not all consolidations have tight pivot points. When a ﬂat base occurs
with no real pivot other than the high of the base, an investor can look to buy
as the stock moves above the highest price at the top of the base provided
that the base corrects no more than 10 or 15 percent. Other price patterns,
such as a cup completion cheat (3-C), or a cup with handle, can form pivot
points below the high of the overall structure.

This step-by-step approach will help you time your trades with accu-
racy as you determine the optimal place for a low-risk and potentially
high-reward trade. If you use the techniques I just described, you will have
more precision and a better rationale for placing your trades. This does
not mean that you will never have a loss or that the stock will not pull
back, hit your stop, and leave you on the sidelines. If your analysis is faulty,
or you’re attempting to trade on the long side during a bear market, the

230

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

search for a pivot may result in frustration instead of a signiﬁcant entry
point or possibly an abrupt failure soon after your purchase. The success
of the pivot point is related to how well the setup has been established.

Squats and Reversal Recoveries

Sometimes a stock will break out from a pivot point only to fall back into
its range and close off the day’s high. This is what I refer to as a squat. When
this happens, I don’t always jump ship right away; I try to wait at least a day
or two to see if the stock can stage a reversal recovery. This accommodation
makes sense especially in a bull market. In some cases it can take up to ten
days or longer for a recovery to occur. This is not a hard-and-fast rule; some
may take a little longer, and some fail and stop you out.

Of course, if the reversal is large enough to trigger my stop, I sell. If the
reversal causes the price to close below its 20-day moving average, it lowers
the probability of success and it becomes a judgment call; sometimes I sell if
this happens. However, as long as the price holds above my stop loss, I try to
give the stock some room.

If the price action tightens and volume subsides, the setup could be
improving, and it could be that you’ve just entered the trade a bit early.
That is precisely what happened with Affymax, Inc. I bought the stock on
August 20, 2012. It closed off the day’s high and even pulled in a bit the very
next day. Over the course of the next few days, the price action tightened
up and volume contracted. I stayed with the stock and held to my origi-
nal stop. Ten days after my purchase, the price recovered into new high
ground, and I added to my position. Affymax, Inc., then advanced 61 per-
cent in 42 days.

squatting on the breakout. It rose 61 percent in 42 days.

ground after going public less than four months earlier. It rose 1,700 percent in

How Do You Know a Breakout Has Failed?

Once a stock breaks out of its pivot area, watch for signs of failure; a failed
breakout can quickly lead to a base failure. Once the stock successfully
breaks out, the stock price should hold its 20-day moving average and in
most cases should not close below it. The pattern should not get wider
(meaning up and down movements). Up is good, but wild swings back and
forth are not. Although the price may pull back or even squat, don’t auto-
matically conclude that the trade is going to fail. You want to give the stock a
chance to recover. If it pulls in, holds above the 20-day average, and squats,
often the stock will recover the next day or within a few days. However, if it
hits your stop, get out and reevaluate.

Dealing with an Early Day Reversal

Another rule of thumb regarding a reversal on the breakout day is the early
day reversal. This occurs when a stock moves up in the morning and then
comes back down to the breakout before noon or 1:00 p.m. Try to give the
stock until the end of the day unless the reversal is so severe that it triggers
your protective stop. You should not panic and conclude that the break-
out has failed just because the early morning rally lost steam and the stock
pulled in. This often happens. The stock may even undercut your pur-
chase price. Stick to your game plan and hold to your original stop loss. In
a healthy market, often stocks that do this will recover later in the day and
close strong.

Putting It All Together

characteristics that were classic in every sense: a perfect VCP setup. Kenneth

Cole attracted my attention when it displayed healthy earnings and sales.
The price and volume action looked great, and the market was starting to
recover after a period of correction.

Note how volatility contracts from left to right; the stock corrects and
progressively tightens within ranges of 32 percent, 14 percent, 7 percent,
and 3 percent. The VCP leads right to an entry point and a successful break-
out. This provides an excellent example of constructive volatility contrac-
tion. The stock emerged and advanced more than 100 percent in just eight
months.

Watch List Organization

An  important  element  for  success  is  how  well  you  can  organize  your
thoughts and analysis. Many traders go through routines, but most of them
lack consistency. Planning your trades in advance allows you to conduct
research when there are no distractions such as level II systems or blinking
quote screens. I conduct my research at around the same time each evening.
By the time the opening bell rings at 9:30 a.m., I already know which stocks
show the most potential and at what price level. I use a kind of shorthand to
indicate the footprint of a stock. I use this shorthand system to get a visual
of the stock at a glance. On September 9, 2012, I was interested in a handful
of names.

You’ll notice that some stocks are circled, one is underlined, some have
asterisks after them, and one has a “pb” notation. You can use whatever
symbols you like, but here is what this all means to me. Circles, asterisks, and

Figure 10.42  My notepad from September 9, 2012

C H A P T E R   1 0   A   P I C T U R E   I S   W O R T H   A   M I L L I O N   D O L L A R S

237

“pb” are part of my ranking that allows me at a glance to see how the stocks
on my watch list are setting up: which ones appear to be ready for action and
which ones need more time to mature.

If I really like a stock, I circle it. If a stock shows potential, I underline
it. If a stock has formed a pivot point, I put in an asterisk after the symbol. If
the pivot point is immediately buyable, I circle the asterisk. If a stock is set-
ting up in such a way that I would be interested on a pullback, I write “pb”
next to it. You will also notice that on the right I use the technical footprint
abbreviation for the names I’m most interested in.

Here’s how this translates into my trading system. Stocks that have
been circled or have asterisks will go on my quote screen for close atten-
tion. Those that are underlined do not have setups that are mature enough
at this point, but they bear watching. The rest will stay on the watch list to
see what develops. I rank them as watch, buy alert, and buy ready. As time
progresses, some stocks may become actionable. Some on the watch list will
move up (from watch to buy alert and then to buy ready), and some will fall
off entirely. Once I have my list of stocks, I can watch how they trade intra-
day. When a stock hits my predetermined price as it moves through its pivot
point, I put on the position.

The Natural Reaction and Tennis Ball Action

In the 1980s, I became intrigued by the methods of the late William M. B.
Berger, a ﬁfth-generation money manager and founder of the Berger Funds.
Bill Berger was a great money manager. His Berger Fund had a very impres-
sive  track  record  and  consistently  included  some  of  the  market’s  most
dynamic leaders. Bill had a saying about price pullbacks that has stuck with
me for decades. He said that price reactions and pullbacks allow you to
determine whether your stock is a tennis ball or an egg. He wanted to own
tennis balls. This has turned out to be a golden nugget that I am now pass-
ing on to you.

Once a stock has penetrated a proper pivot point emerging from a con-
structive price consolidation, it’s time to watch the stock to see how it acts.
This will tell you whether to continue holding it. The stock price will experi-

238

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

ence short-term pullbacks as it makes its way higher. If the stock is healthy
and under accumulation, the pullbacks will be brief and will be met with
support that pushes the stock to new highs within just days, bouncing back
like a tennis ball. This is how you determine whether the stock is experienc-
ing a natural reaction or abnormal activity that should raise concern.

Netﬂix illustrates a successful breakout coming out of a 27W 27/7 3T
VCP setup. You can see the pullbacks are ﬁve and seven days, respectively,
and the stock subsequently moves right back into new high ground. Volume
expanded dramatically on the initial breakout and on the subsequent rally
after the ﬁrst normal reaction. Often, a stock will emerge through a pivot
point and then pull back to or slightly below that initial breakout point.
This is normal as long as the stock recovers fairly quickly within a number
of days or perhaps within one to two weeks. Volume should contract dur-
ing the pullback and then expand as the stock moves back into new highs.

Figure 10.43  Netﬂix (NFLX) 2009
Netﬁx pulled back to the breakout point but came roaring back on huge follow-
through volume just ﬁve days later: classic tennis ball action.

C H A P T E R   1 0   A   P I C T U R E   I S   W O R T H   A   M I L L I O N   D O L L A R S

239

There should not be much volatility during the initial rally phase and dur-
ing the ﬁrst one or two normal reactions. Minor reactions or pullbacks in
price are natural and are bound to occur as the advance runs its course. The
best stocks rebound quickly. This is how you know you’re on to something
worth holding.

Once  you  have  bought  a  stock  emerging  from  a VCP,  look  for  the

following signs:

(cid:115)(cid:0) At the beginning of the move, volume should expand over a

number of days.

(cid:115)(cid:0) Prices generally should move upward for a few days with little

resistance.

high ground.

240

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

(cid:115)(cid:0) A normal reaction will occur: volume should decrease compared
with the volumes observed during the initial trend, and the price
may move against the trend somewhat.

(cid:115)(cid:0) Within a few days or perhaps a week or two of the normal

reaction, volume should increase again and the price trend should
be resumed.

Saucer with Platform

In the 1960s, William L. Jiler wrote a book titled How Charts Can Help You
in the Stock Market. In my opinion, Jiler’s work on chart patterns was way
ahead of its time and to this day still has valuable ﬁndings. I would put
it on the must-read list for anyone interested in using charts to improve
his or her performance in the stock market. Jiler was the ﬁrst to highlight
the saucer-with-platform pattern, which later became popularized as the
cup-with-handle pattern. This pattern without a doubt is the most repeat-
able and reliable price structure among all the variations that superper-
formance stocks trace out before they advance dramatically in price. Jiler
refers to the saucer pattern as a “dream pattern,” citing its ease of recogni-
tion and reliability. Although I agree with Jiler, the pattern is prone to mis-
interpretation. The VCP concept and some education about volume and
certain speciﬁc nuances to look for can quickly clear up poor analysis and
lead you to ﬁnd the next big superperformer. As was mentioned above,

volatility contraction is a key characteristic of constructive price behavior
within all patterns.

The 3C Pattern

The cup completion cheat, or 3C, is a continuation pattern; it is the earliest
point at which you should attempt to buy a stock. Some stocks form a low
cheat, and some form the cheat area, near the middle of the cup or saucer
that precedes it. The key is to recognize when the stock has bottomed and
identify when the start of a new uptrend is under way, back in sync with the
primary stage 2. The cheat trade gives you an actionable pivot point to time
a stock’s upturn while increasing your odds of success.

When a handle forms, it usually occurs in the upper third of the cup. If
it forms in the middle third of the cup or just below the halfway point, you
could get more than one buy point.

Figure 10.50  Cirrus Logic (CRUS) 2010
In February 2010, Cirrus Logic formed a 3C pivot point (cheat area) and then a
handle in March.

Figure 10.51  Valassis Communications (VCI) 2010
In January 2010, a handle formed just above the cheat area; both provided
viable pivot points for entry.

245

The cheat area is the earliest point at which I attempt to trade a cup
pattern. You don’t want to be involved any earlier than this point. Like the
handle, a valid cheat area should exhibit a contraction in volume as well as
tightness in the range of price. This pause presents an opportunity to enter
the trade at the earliest point, perhaps not always with your entire position,
but you can lower your average cost basis by exploiting cheat areas to scale
into trades. Once the stock trades above the high in the pause area, it has
made the turn; it probably has made its low and will resume the longer-term
stage 2 primary trend.

The cheat setup has the same qualiﬁcations as the classic cup with han-
dle because it’s simply the cup portion being completed. To qualify, the
stock should have already moved up by at least 25 to 100 percent—and
in some cases by 200 or 300 percent—during the previous 3 to 36 months
of trading. The stock should also be trading above its upwardly trending
200-day moving average (provided that 200 days of trading in the stock has
occurred). The pattern can form in as few as 3 weeks to as many as 45 weeks

Figure 10.52  Google (GOOG) 2004

percent in 38 weeks.

(most are 7 to 25 weeks in duration). The correction from peak to low point
varies from 15 or 20 percent to 35 or 40 percent in some cases and as much
as 50 percent, depending on the general market conditions. Corrections in
excess of 60 percent are too deep and are extremely prone to failure. It is
common for a cheat setup to develop during a general market correction.
The most powerful stocks will rally off this pattern just as the general market
averages turn up from a correction or at least close to the same time.

Making the Turn

A.   Downtrend. The stock will experience an intermediate-term

price correction that takes place within the context of a longer-
term stage 2 uptrend. This leg down can happen over a number of
weeks or months, and it is normal to experience large price spikes
along the downtrend on increased volume.

B.  Uptrend. The price will attempt to rally and break its downtrend.
You do not want to buy just yet; it’s too early. At this point, the
price and volume action lacks the necessary conﬁrmation that
the stock has bottomed and entered a new uptrend. The price
will start to run up the right side, usually recouping about one-
third to one-half its previous decline; however, overhead supply
created during the intermediate downtrend will typically be strong
enough to stall the price advance and create a pause or pullback.

C.   Pause. The stock will pause over a number of days or weeks

and form a plateau area (the cheat), which should be contained
within 5 percent to 10 percent from high point to low point. The
optimum situation is to have the cheat drift down to where the
price drops below a prior low point, creating a shakeout, exactly
the same thing you would want to see during the formation of a
handle in a cup-with-handle pattern. At this point, the stock is
set up and ready to be purchased as it moves above the high of
the pause. A typical sign that indicates that the stock is ready to
break out is when volume dries up dramatically, accompanied by
tightness in price.

247

Figure 10.53  Cirrus Logic (CRUS) 2010
In March 2010, Cirrus Logic makes the turn as it rallies above the cheat area.

D.  Breakout. As the stock rallies above the high of the plateau area,
you place your buy order. The stock is now deemed to have
made the turn, meaning that it probably has made its low and
the intermediate-term trend is now up and back in sync with the
longer-term stage 2 primary trend.

Why Wait for the Turn?

When a stock has been moving in one direction, a trendline can be drawn by
connecting signiﬁcant highs or lows. The typical rationale is that as long as
the stock price doesn’t break through the trendline—rising above it during
a downtrend or breaking below it during an uptrend—the trend continues.
Then, when the trendline is “broken” because of a change in direction, a
new trend is thought to be in place. Why not just buy when the stock breaks
its trendline? Doesn’t that mean that a new trend has begun? The problem is
that although the trendline has been broken, this could be a temporary phe-

248

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

nomenon. Instead of starting a new trend, the stock could just have made a
momentary move in the other direction until the prevailing trend resumes,
sometimes with even wider volatility, which often happens.

Countertrend volatility is common. This raises the question: How can
you tell when a new trend is in force? The answer is to wait for the stock to
turn. The most dangerous time to trade is when a stock is trying to bot-
tom. This tends to be a very volatile period for stocks. When a stock is
searching for a bottom, it can whip back and forth violently. Trying to
pick a low can be very frustrating and costly. Repeated triggers of your
stop-loss protection during a whipsaw environment inﬂict repeated small
losses that can add up over time. Often a stock will appear as if it is bottom-
ing by breaking its downtrend, only to reverse and then take out the pre-
vious low, deﬁning a new downtrend. As volatility widens, this can occur
over and over. We want to avoid this. You can increase the odds of suc-
cess by waiting for the stock to turn, which will lessen the chance of failure
(although it won’t eliminate it). The odds increase dramatically in your
favor if you wait for the stock not only to rally and break its downtrend but
for the price to pause and then follow through before you place a trade.
This also gives the stock more time to bottom and complete an orderly cor-
rection. Don’t buy just because a trendline is breached; wait for the stock to
turn. The spot to begin buying is just as the high of the pause is taken out.
This could occur at the cheat area or the handle.

The Livermore System

The legendary trader Jesse Livermore had a system of buying and selling
when a stock changed direction, but only if the stock followed through.
Livermore only took positions in the direction of his trade. By waiting for
a stock’s price to conﬁrm a new uptrend, he avoided being whipsawed on
every minor countertrend rally. Instead, Livermore waited for the trend to
be broken and two reactionary pullbacks to take place; then, as the stock
traded above the second reaction high, he would enter a trade. This was
Livermore’s version of the turn. Livermore used this technique to make
more money than any other trader ever.

Jesse Livermore used pivot points (PP) for entry levels. Livermore never bought
at the low; he waited for a change in trend and then starting buying on evidence
that the trend was continuing (i.e., waiting for the high to be taken out after a
natural reaction).

The Failure Reset

The fact that you get stopped out of a stock doesn’t necessarily mean the
underlying fundamentals are bad or the trade has soured; you may just be
the victim of a shakeout. If I am knocked out of a stock, I keep the stock on
my radar to see if it resets technically. At times the subsequent setup is actu-
ally better than the ﬁrst chart pattern, with an even higher probability of
success than what triggered my ﬁrst entry. The fact that it had a shakeout
could turn out to be constructive for the stock going forward. This is what I
call a failure reset, which comes in two forms: a base failure, which requires
building a whole new base before it can be purchased again, and a pivot fail-
ure, which can reset and recover within a small number of days.

Some of my biggest winners were stocks that stopped me out and then

reset. Of course, not all failed setups will reset.

In October 2010, MELI emerged into new high ground, coming out of a
primary base (the ﬁrst buyable base after an IPO). Nine days later the stock
was down 15 percent, enough to stop out most traders. However, if you kept
this name on your watch list, you would have watched it reset in December
2010, and you could have made a very nice proﬁt, as I did. Don’t discard a
stock just because it stops you out; if the fundamentals remain intact, stay
on the lookout for a failure reset.

The Failure (Pivot) Reset

The failure pivot reset is similar to the base reset, except that it occurs dur-
ing the formation of the entry point over a shorter period of time than the
base reset. A pivot failure doesn’t necessarily cause an outright base failure,
instead, it can reset a new entry point usually within a number of days or
weeks.

The Power Play

One of the most important setups you can learn to distinguish is the power
play, which is also referred to as a high tight ﬂag. This is without a doubt the
most misinterpreted price setup among all the technical patterns. However,
it is also one of the most proﬁtable. The power play is what I call a velocity
pattern for two reasons. First, it takes a great deal of momentum to qualify;
in fact, the ﬁrst requirement is a sharp price thrust upward. Second, these
setups can move the fastest in the shortest period of time; velocity begets
more velocity. This pattern often signals a dramatic shift in the prospects of
a company. The rapid price run-up could be induced by a major news devel-
opment such as an FDA drug approval, litigation resolution, a new prod-
uct or service announcement, or even an earnings report; it can also occur

Figure 10.60  TASER Intl. Inc.(TASR) 2004
A strong prior uptrend, tight price action, and extreme volume contraction
formed the perfect setup for an imminent explosion to the upside. Most
investors probably thought this stock looked too high and risky. It rose
329 percent in 16 weeks.

on no news at all. Some of the best trades from this setup can develop as
unexplained strength. Therefore, this is the only situation I will enter with a
dearth of fundamentals. It doesn’t mean that improving fundamentals don’t
exist; very often they do. However, with the power play, the stock is exhibit-
ing so much strength that it’s telling you that something is going on regard-
less of what the current earnings and sales are showing you. The stock is
discounting something major. Although I don’t demand that a power play
have fundamentals on the table, I do require it to display VCP character-
istics just as I do with all the other setups. Even the power play must go
through a proper digestion of supply and demand.

characteristics and strong accelerating earnings leading up to a successful

255

To qualify as a power play, the following criteria must be met:

1.  An explosive price move commences on huge volume that shoots
the stock price up 100 percent or more in less than eight weeks.
This generally occurs after a period of relative dormancy.

2.  The stock price then moves sideways in a relatively tight range, not
correcting more than 20 to 25 percent over a period of three to six
weeks (some can emerge after only 12 days).

3.  There is very tight price action that doesn’t correct the stock more
than 10 percent, or the stock must display VCP characteristics.

In December 1997, I purchased shares of Best Buy Co.

Fundamentally Sound versus Price-Ready

The fact that a company has met all of your fundamental criteria does not
mean that you should necessarily run out and buy it right away. Even if your
fundamental analysis of the company is spot on, to make big money, your
analysis of investor perception also needs to be accurate and timed correctly.
Often a company will deliver one or two great quarterly earnings reports
while the stock is still in a correction or consolidation. The stock price may
have already run up in anticipation, and it simply needs time to digest the
advance while earnings catch up, or perhaps the overall market is in a cor-
rection, holding it back. Be patient. Keep the stock on your radar and wait
for its price and volume characteristics to set up properly. The key to mak-
ing big money in stocks is to align supporting fundamentals with con-
structive price action during a healthy overall market environment. You
want all the forces behind you: fundamental, technical, and market tone. A

stock can be fundamentally sound but not price-ready, meaning that supply
and demand dynamics have not yet established the line of least resistance.
A good company is not always a good stock. It’s important that you learn to
differentiate between the two.

It doesn’t really matter what you think about a stock. What matters is
what big institutions think, because they are the ones that can move a stock’s
price dramatically. Therefore, it’s your job to ﬁnd the companies that insti-
tutions perceive as valuable.

After Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS) issued positive guidance, a strong
response in its stock price put the stock on my watch list. Once it delivered
the strong earnings promised and the stock held up technically, I moved its
status up to buy alert. A few weeks later, constructive price action forged
the setup I was waiting for, and I purchased the stock as it emerged from a
proper consolidation.

Don’t Just Buy

What You Know

Let us say that a new stock has been listed in the last two or three

years and its high was 20, or any other ﬁgure, and that such a price

was made two or three years ago. If something favorable happens in

connection with the company, and the stock starts upward, usually

it is a safe play to buy the minute it touches a brand new high.

—Jesse Livermore, 1930

A s  a  disciplined  trader, you must chart a narrow course in

your quest to score the richest return in the shortest amount of
time. You should buy a stock only when you believe that enough factors
have converged into an optimal setup for an imminent explosion in share
price. A vital ingredient in my entry setups is youth. Some of the most excit-
ing trading opportunities reside in newly public entrepreneurial companies:
ﬁrms that have gone public within the past few months to a year or two. As
a matter of fact, history shows that most superperformers go public within
8 to 10 years before the start of their superperformance phase. But youth
alone doesn’t cut it; I want youth with character! Along with sound funda-
mentals, the type of character I’m referring to becomes evident with a price
setup termed the primary base.

259

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

The Primary Base

Every bull market is represented by a handful of leadership stocks that were
recent IPOs. Generally, a stock will go public, rally strongly on the initial
offering, and maybe even rally for several weeks or months. What usually
follows is proﬁt taking by those who made some quick and relatively easy
money. This will cause the stock to correct. To attract my interest, a new issue
must prove its mettle in the market with at least a couple of months of trad-
ing activity. Proof comes in the form of a primary base: the ﬁrst buyable base
after a company has gone public. The base forms during a corrective period
of three weeks or longer that is followed by the emergence to an all-time high
or from a constructive consolidation near the stock’s all-time high.

During the recovery phase in which it recoups lost ground, the stock
breaks into new high territory. Over the course of a long advance, a lead-
ing stock will form many such bases or consolidations. It will weather the
ensuing proﬁt taking and sell-offs and then proceed to new price highs. The
primary base is simply the ﬁrst occurrence of this bullish chart pattern in a
stock’s trading history. Stocks that began phenomenal advances from pri-
mary bases include Yahoo!, eBay, Google, Starbucks, Reebok, Microsoft,
and Intel, as well as Amazon.com and Research in Motion, to name a few.

The primary base points to the possible future direction of a stock from
its price and volume history, but the primary base has deep roots in so-called
corporate fundamentals as well as the stock’s market action. The biggest
part of a company’s growth usually occurs in the ﬁrst 5 to 10 years after the
company issues common stock and goes public. That’s when the company’s
products or services are expanding into new, untapped markets fueled by
the cash raised in the public offering. This crucial period is when manage-
ment tends to be at its entrepreneurial best. As sales expand and economies
of scale improve, margins are boosted and proﬁt growth accelerates.

Remember, the fact that a company has recently gone public doesn’t
necessarily mean that it has been in business only for a short period. Some
companies operate successfully as private organizations for many decades
before they go public, whereas others are brand new start-ups in new indus-
tries. Eighty percent of the stock market winners that drove the tech boom
during the 1990s were IPOs within the prior eight years. Amazon went

public in May 1997, formed a primary base, and emerged into new high
ground less than four months later in September 1997. Sixteen months later,
Amazon’s stock was 2,500 percent higher than its highest price coming out
of its primary base.

Allow a Primary Base to Develop

Once a stock goes public, it may shoot straight up 25 percent, 50 percent,
100 percent, or even more, sometimes during its very ﬁrst trading day. Or
the new issue may sell off sharply soon after its debut. This was the case for
the much anticipated Facebook IPO in 2012. On its ﬁrst day of public trad-
ing Facebook’s stock traded as high as $45 a share, but by the end of the day’s
session the stock closed at $38.23; 12 days later it was trading 43 percent off
its high at $25.52. Facebook never set up properly and then corrected exces-
sively, rendering it unbuyable.

Before I buy a recent new issue, a stock must have a minimum trading
history: a primary base. Some IPOs can take up to a year or more to form a
proper base. In most cases, you should insist that the stock put in a base of at

least three to ﬁve weeks and not correct more than 25 to 35 percent to be reli-
able. Corrections that last longer (usually around one year) sometimes result
in a decline of as much as 50 percent, yet the setup can still be sound. Shorter
three-week consolidations should not correct more than 25 percent. Let’s say
you spot a promising new issue. The company has an exciting new product
or service. Sales growth and earnings growth are accelerating. Now you must
wait for the market to conﬁrm your fundamental belief. Your opinion about
a company is worthless unless it is veriﬁed by the price action of the stock.
As the technical pioneer Jesse Livermore wrote: “Apply strict attention to the
action of the market itself. Markets are never wrong—opinions often are.”
That conﬁrmation will display itself in the stock’s successful emergence to
new high ground from its ﬁrst viable consolidation: the primary base.

A Primary Base Few Would Consider

people to sell the stock after they bought late and the story had become obvi-
ous to everyone. Suddenly everyone had to own Yahoo!, America Online,
Qualcomm, Nokia, Oracle, and a host of other names that a year or two
earlier had fallen on deaf ears. When the timing was perfect, no one wanted
to hear about them because the names weren’t familiar and they were trad-
ing at what looked like high multiples. Many of these stocks were emerg-
ing when the market had just suffered a bear market decline and the world
was focused on the Asian crisis. In July 1997, I bought Yahoo!. The stock

sors. Rambus went public on May 14, 1997 (point A). The stock made a huge
advance the day of the IPO, closing strong. The price then traded sideways for
about ﬁve weeks. Rambus broke to a new high emerging from a primary base
on June 16, 1997 (point B). The stock blasted off over the next four days. It
peaked on June 19 (point C) before settling into a second sideways consoli-
dation, which lasted about six weeks. On July 29, the stock cleared another
new high, emerging from a second stage base (point D) which set the stage for
another powerful run that sent the price up dramatically once again. Rambus
is a classic example of a primary base that provided a stellar investment
opportunity for a watchful investor as well as several trading opportunities.

Body Central Corp.
In December 2011, while Christmas shopping in a mall, I spotted the retailer

the company reported huge earnings increases in the most recent quar-
ters. Even more interesting was the fact that the stock had gone public only
a couple of months earlier. To me, this smelled like opportunity. When I

ume. The price consolidation was sound, the earnings were strong, the com-
pany was relatively small with a scalable business, and management seemed
to be doing the right things, and so I took my position. The stock advanced
more than 100 percent over the next 15 months. During the same period,
the Nasdaq Composite Index was up less than 10 percent.

Not Every Frog Becomes a Prince

Not every stock that makes a new high from a primary base turns out to be
a big winner, and although a proper primary base affords an investor some
of the best odds to participate during the majority of a big move, there is no
guarantee of catching a stock as it begins a large-scale advance. Therefore,
you must always be prepared with an exit plan to cut your losses if a primary
base turns against you.

In January 2006, I bought shares of iRobot as the stock was emerg-
ing from a primary base. Shortly after that purchase, the stock came off,
couldn’t rally, and then began to sell off even more. I sold the stock at a small

from a peak above $37 a share to just $7. I was able to cut my loss short and
avoid a big loss because I followed rules and didn’t allow my judgment to
become clouded by personal opinions or emotions.

From Innovator to Respirator

Just as styles in women’s gowns and hats and costume jewelry are

forever changing with time, the old leaders of the stock market are

dropped and new ones rise up to take their places. In the course

of time new leaders will come to the front: some of the old leaders

will be dropped. It will always be that way as long as there is a stock

market. Keep mentally ﬂexible. Remember the leaders of today may

not be the leaders two years from now.

The Richmond, Virginia–based big-box retailer Circuit City ﬁled for bank-
ruptcy in 2008. Circuit City was a pioneer among superstores, and its stock

268

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

price soared during the 1980s and 1990s, up over 6,000 percent during a
10-year run. In fact, from 1981 through 2000, Circuit City’s stock price
advanced more than 63,000 percent. Although Circuit City was one of the
nation’s strongest retailers in the 1980s, it made a series of critical mis-
steps that accumulated over time. Its best growth came during the period
when the company was relatively small, and its problems accelerated as it
grew much larger. In 2008, Circuit City was still the nation’s second largest
dedicated consumer electronics retailer after Best Buy, with more than 700
stores. The company planned to close 155 existing stores, open fewer new
ones, renegotiate some leases, and cut staff members at its headquarters.
This is the opposite of what you see during a company’s expansion phase,
when the future for growth is promising. Those who held shares of Circuit
City watched the stock price go to zero in 2008.

Beware of well-known companies that everyone regards as “ofﬁcial
growth stocks.” Like Circuit City, these institutional favorites generally have
already experienced their best earnings growth and are too obvious once
they are ofﬁcially termed growth stocks. At some point they are so over-
owned that the amount of supply that comes to market once a material
problem is noticed can bring down the house. Instead, buy the new market
leaders; don’t be afraid of companies that are unfamiliar to you. Do some
detective work and get familiar with stocks that are forming a primary base.
This is where many of the next big winners will be found.

Risk Management

Part 1: The Nature of Risk

I n virtually every competitive endeavor, there’s a champi-

onship. In American sports, it’s the Super Bowl, the World Series, and
the NBA Finals. In entertainment, there’s the Academy Awards, the Emmy
Awards, and the Tony Awards. Trading is no different. For many years, the
best of the best tested their mettle against a host of competitors, from ama-
teurs to professionals, in the U.S. Investing Championship (USIC).

The USIC competition was started in 1983 by Norman Zadeh and
quickly became a proving ground for stock, options, and futures traders.
Zadeh’s career encompassed mathematics, market speculation, and gam-
bling; he authored Winning Poker Systems in 1974 and taught mathematics
at Stanford University and UCLA. Although a gifted theoretical mathemati-
cian, Zadeh understood the inability of static academic theory to grasp the
reality of real-life auction markets. His consuming goal was to disprove the
efﬁcient markets theory, a point he particularly wanted to bring home to the
academic crowd. He would do this by demonstrating that certain individu-
als could indeed outperform the market. The USIC was just the vehicle to
prove it while earning a personal proﬁt!

The U.S. Investing Championship quickly became a prestigious con-
test, and many of the traders who won it went on to big investment careers.
In its early years, the USIC was divided into four divisions: stocks, options,
stocks and options, and futures. Through the contest, Zadeh was able to
scout trading talent and then sign up a diverse list of individuals to manage
money for his clients.

I can remember reading about the winners in the Wall Street Journal in
the 1980s. A young trader by the name of David Ryan won the contest three
years in a row between 1984 and 1986, a magniﬁcent achievement. Another
well-known champ was S&P futures trader Martin “Buzzy” Schwartz. Both
Ryan and Schwartz would later be proﬁled by Jack Schwager in his ﬁrst
Market Wizards book. To me, it was clear that to win the USIC and join the
ranks of these champions was to join an elite circle.

In 1996, at age 31, I decided to enter the contest. I felt conﬁdent that
my skills had reached the point where I could win. Whoever made the
most money during a one-year period was the champion; pretty simple.
The account size required for entry was $25,000. I posted the $25,000 and
traded in my usual style: aggressively with supertight risk control. Each day,
I combed my watch list to determine the best possible moment for execut-
ing a trade. Although I was conﬁdent of victory, I kept my focus on sticking
to my trading plan. My goal, as always, was to make as much money as pos-
sible, but only by executing the best trades at the optimal time, never by tak-
ing impulsive actions that deviated from my trading regime.

At the end of the ﬁrst quarter, I was up 49.72 percent and had run the
$25,000 account up to $37,430. Quarterly results were not being published
publicly at the time, and so I had no idea how well my performance stacked
up against those of the other traders. By the end of the second quarter, I
really hit my stride. My account was up an additional 93.75 percent, bring-
ing my total return for the ﬁrst six months to +190.08 percent. My contest
trading account was at $72,521, and I had the feeling I was pretty well posi-
tioned in the ﬁeld of competitors.

Shortly after that day I got an unexpected phone call from one of the
contest coordinators. He told me that the championship was being sus-
pended because of an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission
about an advertisement issue relating to previously published performance
results. I couldn’t believe it. I had ﬁnally decided to enter the USIC, and the
SEC was closing it down! “Can you at least tell me where I stand, what place
I’m in?” I asked. If nothing else, I would have the satisfaction of knowing
how I ranked among the other competitors.

“Mark, you’re way in the lead by more than 100 percent,” he told me.

C H A P T E R   1 2   R I S K   M A N A G E M E N T   P A R T   1

I thanked him for the opportunity and hung up the phone very dis-
appointed. Here I was, way out in front so that it would be very difﬁcult
for anyone to catch me, and now the contest was closed, probably forever.
But as with a bad trade, when disappointment comes, you deal with it and
move on.

Later that year, I received another call from the contest organizer, who
explained that the issues with the SEC had been resolved and the contest
was back on. The competition would resume on January 1, 1997. However,
the results of 1996 would not carry over. It was a new contest. If I wanted to
enter, I had to start all over again. My 190 percent performance in the ﬁrst
six months would be for my own ediﬁcation alone. It wasn’t ofﬁcial, and
although it might make a nice story, nobody would ever see it or care.

New  rules  were  set  for  the  1997  championship:  two  divisions,  one
designed for personal trading accounts ranging from $200,000 to $999,000
and one for combined managed accounts of $1 million and higher, with
no restrictions on what could be traded in either division; the contestants
were free to trade in stocks, options, futures, or any mixture. Although
this seemed incredibly unfair—a pure stock guy like me going up against
options and futures traders who could use massive leverage—I decided to
enter the ﬁrst division, putting up $250,000 of my own money.

In the ﬁrst quarter, I was up just a little over 8 percent; that was not
nearly enough to qualify for the top spot, but it was the ﬁnal tally I was
concerned with. This time the contest results were published quarterly in
Investor’s Business Daily and Barron’s. Quarter by quarter, the world could
track the performance of the top competitors. During the ﬁrst two quarters
I was in the top 20, but there were opponents who were far ahead of me. I
knew that I must not let being behind affect my trading or cloud my judg-
ment. I had to play the game my way, which meant taking only the best
trades according to my criteria and exercising tight control over each execu-
tion. There was real money on the line, and so doing something stupid and
risky just to win the contest was not an option. I made a commitment to stay
with my game plan through the entire year, knowing it was sound.

By the third quarter, things had changed quite a bit. I was now neck
and neck with my closest competitor, separated by a mere tenth of a per-

272

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

centage point. I was in ﬁrst place, up 110.10 percent, and the trader in sec-
ond place stood at an even +110.00 percent. Then, in the fourth quarter,
the market corrected; it was a very tough trading environment. The Dow
peaked in October and corrected 10 percent. This was just the scenario I
had hoped for. I knew that during a difﬁcult period not only would my dis-
cipline avert giving back my proﬁts, I could actually make money trading.
This was something that I felt conﬁdent few could achieve. Over the next
several months I traded ﬁercely and pulled away from the pack. My ﬁnal
tally was a total return of 155 percent, almost double that of the nearest
competitor. I was grateful to be named the 1997 U.S. Investing Champion
by Money Manager Veriﬁed Ratings.

The point of this story is simple. The uneven playing ﬁeld of highly
leveraged options and futures traders trading against straight stock guys
could have pressured me to take on too much risk or overtrade. I also could
have gotten ﬂustered when I was signiﬁcantly behind and tried to make an
adjustment, breaking my own rules. But I didn’t. Instead, I focused on my
trading plan and the two elements that were absolutely critical to winning
over the long haul: consistency and risk management.

What Champions Have in Common

People buy stocks in hopes of making money and increasing their wealth.
They dream of the great returns that their carefully chosen investments
will yield in the future. Before investing your hard-earned cash, however,
you’d better think about how you will avoid losing it. If there’s one thing
I’ve learned over the years, it’s that risk management is the most important
building block for achieving consistent success in the stock market. Notice
that I said “consistent.”

Anyone can have short-term success by being in the right place at the
right time, but consistency is what differentiates the pros from the amateurs,
the timeless legends from the one-hit wonders. I once bowled a 259 during
my very ﬁrst year playing in a Wednesday night league. It was a bizarre aber-
ration. My average was only 129, and I would never break 200 again. During

C H A P T E R   1 2   R I S K   M A N A G E M E N T   P A R T   1

273

my career, I’ve witnessed many people make millions of dollars during good
times, only to give it all back and even go broke. I’m going to tell you how to
avoid that fate.

It’s Your Money Only
as Long as You Protect It

Whether you are dealing in millions or in thousands the same

principle lesson applies. It is your money. It will remain with you

just so long as you guard it. Faulty speculation is one of the most

certain ways of losing it.

—Jesse L. Livermore

To achieve consistent proﬁtability, you must protect your proﬁts and prin-
cipal. As a matter of fact, I don’t differentiate between the two. A big mistake
I see many traders make is to consider trading proﬁts as house money, act-
ing as if that money somehow were less their own to lose than their origi-
nal starting capital is. If you have fallen into this mental habit, you need to
change your perception immediately to achieve superperformance.

Let’s say I make $5,000 on Monday. I don’t consider myself $5,000
“ahead of the game,” free to risk that amount shooting for the moon.
My account simply has a new starting balance, subject to the same set of
rules as before. Once I make a proﬁt, that money belongs to me. Yesterday’s
proﬁt is part of today’s principal.

Don’t fall into the faulty reasoning of amateur gamblers. Through
consistent play and conservative wagering, a player picks up $1,500 at the
blackjack table. Then he starts to make big, reckless bets. In his eyes, he now
is playing with house money. This happens all the time in the stock mar-
ket. Amateur investors treat their gains like the market’s money instead of
their money, and in due time the market takes it back. Let’s say someone
buys a stock at $20 a share. It climbs to $27. Then the investor decides he
can “give it room” because he has a seven-point cushion. Wrong! Once a
stock moves up a decent amount from my purchase price, I usually give it

274

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

less room on the downside. I go into a proﬁt-protection mode. At the very
least, I protect my breakeven point. I’m certainly not going to let a good
gain turn into a loss.

At the end of each trading session, when you review your portfolio, ask
yourself this: Am I bullish on this position today? If not, why am I holding
it? Does your original reason for going long remain valid? End every trading
day with a frank appraisal of all your positions.

I’m not suggesting that you not allow a stock to go through a normal
reaction or pullback in price if you believe the stock can go much higher.
Of course, you should give stocks some room to ﬂuctuate, but that leeway
has little to do with your past gain. Evaluate your stocks on the basis of
the return you expect from them in the future versus what you’re risking.
Each day, a stock must justify your conﬁdence in holding it for a greater
proﬁt.

Sound Principles Provide Clarity

My biggest losses have always come after I have had a great period

and I started to think that I knew something.

—Paul Tudor Jones

There are certainly times when money can be made very easily in the stock
market. Often this leads to carelessness, which in turn can lead to disaster.
At the end of the day, success is not decided by your winnings from any
particular day, month, or quarter; it’s what you keep year in and year out.
Adherence to sound risk-management principles will not only allow you
keep the proﬁts you’ve acquired but will also keep your feet on the ground
when your head is in the sky because you’ve become overly ambitious after
a period of success.

You’ve undoubtedly heard the phrase “cut your losses and let your
winners  ride.” When  I  was  interviewed  by  Jack  Schwager  for  his  book
Stock  Market  Wizards:  Interviews  with  America’s  Top  Stock  Traders
(HarperBusiness 2001, 2003), I spent a lot of time talking about loss cutting

C H A P T E R   1 2   R I S K   M A N A G E M E N T   P A R T   1

275

as the key to my success. At one point during the interview, Jack stopped the
tape recorder and said, “Mark, this stuff is great, but it’s a cliché; it’s what all
the successful traders say.”

“Jack, of course that’s what they say,” I told him. “That’s why they’re

successful, and that’s why I’m successful.”

When you have been trading for a long time, you can easily lose per-
spective as you cultivate new techniques. If you’re not careful, the basic
fundamentals may come in your mind or, more subtly, in your subcon-
scious to seem remedial. Far from being training wheels to be cast off with
maturity, the basics of risk management must be continually refreshed in
your mind and perfected. Maybe that sounds unexciting, but as the leg-
endary quarterback Roger Staubach said, “It takes a lot of unspectacular
practice to get spectacular results.”

A Lesson from Master Jack

Part of my obsession with perfecting the basics goes back to my days as a kid
in karate school. I was somewhat gifted as far as being able to do gymnastic-
type maneuvers, and after only a short time I could do all sorts of complex
karate moves and even a backward no-hand ﬂip. They gave me the nick-
name Movie Man because of my ability to do the types of moves you saw
in kung fu ﬁlms. Even so, I was still a novice, and my teacher, Master Jack
Moscato, knew I needed humbling.

One day, Master Jack told me to assume the basic front stance, which
is one of the very ﬁrst things you learn. He walked around me quietly and
then suddenly kicked out my front leg. I fell crashing to the ground. When I
looked up in surprise, Master Jack stared down at me and said, “Maybe you
should learn to stand before you learn to ﬂip.” That lesson has stayed with
me ever since. Master the basics. My karate instructor was a stickler for per-
fecting the basics.  Every day, remind yourself that the key building blocks
for success include executing the basics better than the other guy and doing
it over and over again. Greatness is built on a solid foundation of fundamen-
tal principles.

Losses Make You Work Harder

When you lose money on a stock trade, you will need a greater percentage
gain to get back to even because losses work against you geometrically. For
example, if a stock declines 50 percent in price, let’s say from $28 to $14, that
stock will have to rise by 100 percent (from $14 to $28) to get back to even.
That’s worth repeating: a 50 percent decline in price requires a double to
break even.

What happens if you keep your losses relatively small? A 10 percent loss
requires an 11 percent gain to return to even, and a 5 percent loss needs only
a 5.26 percent gain. This is why you never want to let your losses get too
large. Also, if you lose a big portion of your account, you lose your buying
power. Your account will be much smaller when you ﬁnally latch on to a big
winner. The last thing you want to do is put yourself in a position of losing
when your account is large and a position of gaining when it’s small; this
will accomplish little. By keeping your losses small, you preserve your hard-
earned capital for future investments.

The lesson here is never to permit yourself to lose an amount of
money that would jeopardize your account. The larger the loss is, the
more difﬁcult it is to recover from it. Set an absolute maximum line in the
sand of no more than 10 percent on the downside. Your average loss should
be much less, maybe 6 or 7 percent. If you can’t be correct on your purchase
with a 10 percent cushion for normal price ﬂuctuation, you have a different

C H A P T E R   1 2   R I S K   M A N A G E M E N T   P A R T   1

277

problem to address. Either your selection criteria and timing are ﬂawed or
the overall market is hostile and you should be out of stocks.

Two Up and One Down

If I guaranteed you a three year compounded return consisting of two 50
percent up years and one 50 percent down year, that may sound like a pretty
good deal, but think again. Regardless of the order, you would have a three-
year total return of 12.5 percent, or about 4 percent per year. That’s not
exactly the type of return you hope for when investing in stocks, especially
taking into consideration all the risks you have to take. Actually, there’s no
good “two up, one down” deal. About the best you can hope for is two 30
percent gains and one 30 percent loss, which results in a return of about
5.75 percent per year; still not very impressive. This demonstrates how losses
work geometrically against you. To achieve big results, your gains must
eclipse your losses on a risk/reward basis—period!

Convincing Myself:
The Loss Adjustment Exercise

The deﬁnition of a great investor is someone who starts by

understanding the downside.

—Sam Zell

278

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

Early in my career, I did not understood the dramatic effect of losses and the
importance of cutting them short. Like most traders, I had periods of suc-
cess followed by some fairly drastic drawdowns because of a few trades gone
wrong. I thought loss cutting sounded logical and tried to apply it to my
trading, but every now and then I would break the rule, hoping that things
would turn around, sometimes holding on to my favorite position for dear
life. It got to the point where I was confused, and so I decided to test the
effects of cutting my losses on all my trades.

I decided to adjust all of my past losses to an arbitrary level of 10 per-
cent to see what the effect of capping the downside would be. This included
adjusting the losses that were smaller up to 10 percent as well as adjusting
the ones that were larger down. As I said, occasionally I would hold on to
a stock that had fallen, and from time to time I would take 20 percent and
even 30 percent losses. When I adjusted those losses and capped them at
10 percent, the effect on my performance was amazing. Capping the losses
would have knocked me out of a few of my winners; however, this con-
sequence was overwhelmed by the loss-cutting effect. The hypothetical
improvement in the overall portfolio performance seemed too dramatic to
be believed. I rechecked the math two or three times, and the numbers were
correct. Instead of having a double-digit percentage loss in my portfolio, I
would have had a gain of more than 70 percent.

Is it possible that such a small alteration could have such a dramatic
impact on performance? Absolutely! This revelation was a pivotal point in
my trading. I was convinced that risk management was the key to success.
From that point on, I grew very risk adverse, and my results improved dra-
matically. I religiously cut my losses and as a result attained a whole new
level of performance. I call this the Loss Adjustment Exercise. Try it; it’s an
eye-opener.

Back in the 1980s, my trading account’s distribution of gains and losses

looked like this:

(cid:115)(cid:0) Gains: (6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17, 18, 20, 28, 50 percent) 18.40 percent

average gain

(cid:115)(cid:0) Compounded return: –12.05 percent

(cid:115)(cid:0) Adjust losses to –10 percent (including the ones that are smaller

up to –10 percent)

(cid:115)(cid:0) Compounded return: +79.89 percent

Note: The order in which the trades are compounded doesn’t matter;

the result is the same.

Accepting the Market’s Judgments

Nothing can drag you down if you’re not holding on to it.

—Tony Robbins

The stock market offers tremendous potential rewards and opportunities
for virtually anyone. As a disciplined investor, you have good reason to be
optimistic about your chances for success. But the stock market can strike
without notice, transforming your lofty dreams into a ﬁnancial nightmare,
a lesson learned by the tens of millions of investors who suffered huge losses
during the bear market that began in March 2000 and those who attempted
to ride out the storm in the bear market of 2007–2008. Whether you’re
investing in blue chip stocks or trading pork bellies, any seasoned pro will
tell you that there is no room for ego. The market can and will break anyone
who ignores the risks and dangers. With each bear market a new group of
investors learn this lesson the hard way.

The ﬁrst discipline you need to learn to be a successful stock trader
is simple to comprehend mentally, but for the majority of traders it’s the
most difﬁcult to perform regularly: the best way to stay clear of the mar-
ket’s wrath is to accept its judgment.

Knowing When You’re Wrong

Good trading is a peculiar balance between the conviction to follow

your ideas and the ﬂexibility to recognize when you have made a

mistake.

—Michael Steinhardt

I’ve been asked, “How do you know when you’re wrong?” My answer is
always, “The stock goes down.” It’s that simple. As a matter of fact, I will
often sell a stock if it doesn’t go up shortly after I buy it. Even though it has
not gone down, if the stock doesn’t do what I expected it to do, that’s rea-
son enough to step aside and reevaluate. When a stock you have bought
falls below your purchase price, it is telling you have made an error—at a
minimum in timing. Make no mistake, whether you’re a short-term trader

C H A P T E R   1 2   R I S K   M A N A G E M E N T   P A R T   1

281

or a long-term investor, timing is everything. Just as much money is lost on
great companies bought at the wrong time as on investments that were poor
choices in the ﬁrst place. Regardless of your methodology or approach
to stock investing, there is only one way to protect your portfolio from a
large loss, and that is to sell when you have a small loss before it snowballs
into a huge one. In three decades of trading, I have not found a better way.
Amazingly, no matter how many successful investors advocate this
commonsense approach, this advice is followed only by an extremely small
group of people even among professionals. Consequently, only a very small
number of investors (including pros) achieve outstanding results in the
stock market. Without a doubt, the hardest discipline for investors to fol-
low consistently is to cut their losses short because it involves admitting that
one’s original purchase was a mistake, and no one likes to be wrong.

Avoid the Big Errors

What vulnerabilities do we have and what can we do to minimize

them, to get around them, to survive them—and give ourselves a

better chance to win”

—Bobby Knight

Recently I had a chance to speak with Itzhak Ben-David, coauthor of the
study Are Investors Really Reluctant to Realize Their Losses? Trading Responses
to Past Returns and the Disposition Effect. The tendency to sell winners too
soon and to keep losers too long has been called the disposition effect by
economists.

Mr. Ben-David and David Hirshleifer studied stock transactions from
more than 77,000 accounts at a large discount broker from 1990 through
1996 and did a variety of analyses that had never been done before. They
examined when investors bought individual stocks, when they sold them,
and how much they earned or lost with each sale. They also examined when
investors were more likely to buy additional shares of a stock they had pre-
viously purchased. Their results were published in the August 2012 issue of
the Review of Financial Studies.

282

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

The study highlights several interesting conclusions:

(cid:115)(cid:0)

Investors are more likely to allow a stock to reach a large loss than
they are to allow a stock to attain a large gain; they hold losers too
long and sell winners too quickly.

(cid:115)(cid:0) The probability of buying additional shares is greater for shares
that have lost value than it is for shares that have gained value;
investors may readily double down on their bets when stocks
decline in value.

(cid:115)(cid:0)

Investors are more likely to take a small gain than a small loss.

Most investors are simply too slow in closing out losing positions. As a
result, they hold on until they can’t take the pain anymore, and that eats up
precious capital and valuable time. To be successful, you must keep in mind
that the only way you can continue to operate is to protect your account
from a major setback or, worse, devastation. Avoiding large losses is the
single most important factor for winning big as a speculator. You can’t
control how much a stock rises, but in most cases, whether you take a
small loss or a big loss is entirely your choice. There is one thing I can guar-
antee: if you can’t learn to accept small losses, sooner or later you will take
big losses. It’s inevitable.

To  master  the  craft  of  speculation,  you  must  face  your  destructive
capacity; once you understand and acknowledge this capacity, you can con-
trol your destiny and achieve consistency. You should focus a signiﬁcant
amount of time and effort on learning how to lose the smallest amount pos-
sible when you’re wrong. You must learn to avoid the big errors.

Don’t Become an Involuntary Investor

Because investors hate to admit mistakes, they rationalize. They ﬂuctuate from
being “traders” when they’re right—getting in and out of proﬁtable stock posi-
tions in the short term—to becoming “investors” when they are wrong. When
their trades move against them and start to rack up losses, all of a sudden they
decide to hold on for the long term. They become what Jesse Livermore called

C H A P T E R   1 2   R I S K   M A N A G E M E N T   P A R T   1

283

an “involuntary investor,” a person who harvests a bitter crop of small proﬁts
and large losses, the exact opposite of what you want to achieve.

Every major correction begins as a minor reaction. You can’t tell
when a 10 percent decline is the beginning of a 50 percent decline until
after the fact, when it’s too late. No one can know for sure that a stock will
decline only a certain amount and then move higher. If you had known
that your stock was going to drop 15 percent or 20 percent, would you have
bought it in the ﬁrst place? Of course not. The fact that the stock is below
your purchase price means you made a mistake in timing, which happens
50 to 60 percent of the time on average. The best traders may pick winning
stocks about 60 or 70 percent of the time in a healthy market, which means
30 to 40 percent of their stock picks lose money.

In fact, you can be correct on only 50 percent of your stock selections
and still enjoy huge success, but only if you keep your losses in check. You
can make money by picking winning stocks only one time out of two or
even three trades, but only if you sell your losers before they inﬂict an insur-
mountable toll on your account. Every dollar saved is a dollar earned, and
every dollar saved is more money that can be compounded when you latch
on to your next big winner. Don’t become an involuntary investor.

How Low Can It Go?

It would be simple to run down the list of hundreds of stocks which,

in my time, have been considered gilt-edge investments, and which

today are worth little or nothing. Thus, great investments tumble,

and with them the fortunes of so-called conservative investors in the

continuous distribution of wealth.

—Jesse Livermore

Some investors feel they don’t need to trade with a stop loss because they
buy only quality stocks. There’s no such thing as a safe stock. Many “con-
servative investors” have gone broke owning and holding on to so-called
blue chip companies for a long-term investment with the philosophy that
patience is prudence by way of quality. If this is your strategy, I’m afraid you

284

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

will eventually be in for an unpleasant surprise. This is simply a lazy person’s
strategy, or lack of strategy.

I can’t tell you how many times I’ve heard “They’re not going to go out
of business” because it’s Coke or Apple or some other well-known name.
Maybe they won’t go out of business and maybe they will, or maybe the
stock will correct 70 percent or more and take a decade to recover. Coke
topped in 1973, declined 70 percent from its high, and then took 11 years
to get back to even. Sure, investors received a dividend of a few percent per
year, but that doesn’t even beat inﬂation, and they were still sitting with a big
fat loss. In 1998, Coca-Cola topped again; the stock declined for ﬁve years
and took an almost 50 percent haircut.

Vast numbers of “high-quality” companies had periods when their
stock prices were decimated. After topping out in 1973, shares in Eastman
Kodak took 14 years to break even, just in time for the crash of 1987,
which tanked the stock again, and then it took another 8 years to reach its
1973 high.

Xerox also topped in 1973, and it took 24 years to break even; during
that period the S&P 500 advanced more than 500 percent. In the 1960s,
Avon Products became so popular that the stock price ran up way ahead of
its earnings, resulting in a price advance that took the stock from $3 in 1958
to $140 per share in 1972. Then the stock topped out and plunged from
$140 to $19, an 86 percent drop in only one year. Fourteen years later the
stock was still at $19 a share.

In the 32 month period from December 1999 through February 2002,
McDonald’s fell 72 percent. In August 2000, AT&T began a slide that took
its shares down 80 percent in less than four years. Starting in April 2000,
Cisco Systems plunged 90 percent in 30 months. In 2000, institutional
favorite Lucent Technologies topped and fell 99 percent in 35 months.

No  stock  can  be  held  forever.  Few  stocks  can  be  held  unattended
for  even  a  few  months  without  risk.  Good  companies  can  be  terrible
stock investments if they are bought at the wrong time. Many so-called
investment-grade companies today will face new challenges, deteriorat-
ing business conditions, or regulatory changes that can materially affect
their future earnings potential. Often, before problems become apparent,

C H A P T E R   1 2   R I S K   M A N A G E M E N T   P A R T   1

285

the price of a stock declines precipitously in anticipation of such devel-
opments. But management said everything is great, right? When funda-
mental problems arise in a public company, management is probably your
worst source of information. The executives will try everything in their
power legally, and in some cases illegally, to bamboozle the shareholders
in an effort to protect the stock price. In 2008, General Motors went to
zero. How about AIG and Lehman Brothers, or before them Enron and
WorldCom? These are just a few of the market’s casualties that were once
high-quality names.

How low can it go? To zero!

A Trip to the Casino

Consistent winners raise their bet as their position strengthens,

and they exit the game when the odds are against them, while

consistent losers hang on until the bitter end of every expensive pot,

hoping for miracles and enjoying the thrill of defeat. In stud poker

and on Wall Street, miracles happen just often enough to keep the

losers losing.

—Peter Lynch, One Up on Wall Street

The  ﬁrst  time  I  saw  seven-card  stud  being  played  at  a  casino,  it  didn’t
take me more than a few minutes to see the similarities to trading stocks.
The ante (the initial bet to see the ﬁrst three cards of the deal) was $0.50.
However, the pot (what the winner pulled in for a winning hand) averaged
about $50. Thus, for half a buck, players could get a fair idea of their chances
of winning 100 times the ante.

After a night at the table, I was ahead about $1,400. My secret? I played
cards the way I trade stocks: immediately folding the ones that didn’t work
out as expected. If I didn’t receive a decent playable hand on the deal, I
didn’t continue betting against the other players. I tossed in my cards and
accepted the small loss of $0.50 as the cost of doing business. I knew that
when I had a winning hand, I could make back the amount of my loss many
times over. I probably folded 30 hands in a row at times, which at $0.50 an

286

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

ante meant a $15 loss. But the average winning pot was $50. If I folded 50
times and won only once, I would still win twice as much as I lost.

Why didn’t the other players fold when I played a hand after realizing
that I went forward only when I had solid cards? Ego! Big ego equals small
discipline. Undisciplined players looking for “action” always show up at the
poker tables. The stock market is no different except that most stock market
investors are even less disciplined than most poker players. The Achilles’ heel
of most gamblers and speculators is the desire to play every hand, a com-
mon human weakness that allows impatience to override good judgment.
Folding mediocre cards at the poker table is the same as selling off stocks
soon after they fall below your purchase price to protect your account.
Losing trades are inevitable. By limiting your losses, you will put yourself
way ahead of the majority of investors because most investors lack disci-
pline. The best traders are the ones who recognize mistakes, dispassionately
cut their losses, and move on, preserving capital for the next opportunity.

One in a Million

As a trader, which is the better deal, $1,000 guaranteed or $1 million with
a 1 percent chance of losing everything? It’s really not an either-or answer.
Notice the key words “as a trader.” Now think about something: If you were
a lawyer, would you go to trial just once? If you were a surgeon, would you
conduct just one operation? As a stock trader, are your decisions based on
a one-time event? Of course not. As a stock trader, you probably will make
hundreds if not thousands of stock transactions over your lifetime.

The answer to the question is that if it’s a one-time event, take the mil-
lion. However, if it involves many trades, say, 100 or more transactions, the
1 percent probability will deﬁnitely leave you broke; hence, take the sure
thing: the $1,000.

If you’re going to become a stock trader, you will be trading for years,
maybe even decades. If you regard each trade as just one out of a million over
time, it becomes much easier to take a small loss and move on to the next
trade. If you stay disciplined, apply good judgment, and play the high-proba-
bility situations, the odds will distribute over time and you will be proﬁtable.

In poker and in the stock market, you’re playing probabilities, not cer-
tainties; that means you cannot be correct all the time. If you make more on
your winners than you lose on your losers over time, that’s all you need to
accomplish to be successful. I regard each trade as just one of many in a long
continuous trading session: one in a million.

What’s the Difference?

You buy a stock at $30 because you think it looks good, the fundamen-
tals look great, the future appears bright, and the stock price is acting well.
Suddenly, the company announces that earnings per share will come in well
below estimates as a result of a manufacturing plant not opening up as sched-
uled. The next day the stock falls 10 percent below your purchase price right
at the open. You’re faced with the decision to sell and take a loss or wait it out.
My question is this: What’s the difference if you continue to hold the
stock that has declined by 10 percent, waiting for it to come back and
overcome the negative news, or buy a fresh new name that looks good
from the start? The answer is: nothing but your ego. Successful investors
can shift gears and accept change. They don’t fall in love with a stock and
ignore when circumstances take a turn for the worse; the goal is to make
money, not to prove you’re right and the stock market is wrong. Move on
and ﬁnd another stock. What’s the difference whether you make money
with stock A or stock B? If your original stock was at $30 and it’s now at
$27,  it has to go up about 11 percent to get you back to even. It’s no dif-
ferent if you buy a new stock at, say, $50 and it goes to $56 than if you hold
on to your current position and wait for it to go back to $30, except maybe
the new company will open its plant on time.

What a Deal

When you play poker, it costs money to see your cards from the deal; you
must pay an ante, or post blinds, as well as pay the house “time” to partici-
pate in the game. Now imagine you could see every poker hand for free and
place your bets only when the cards were stacked in your favor. How could

288

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

you lose over time? One of the great things about the stock market is that all
comers compete in the same ring: skilled and unskilled, professionals and
amateurs. This is one of the reasons the market is not purely random. In the
stock market, you have the luxury of being able to stay on the sidelines,
free of charge, observing and waiting for the most opportune moment to
wager. You get to see the market’s “cards” before you bet, free of charge.
This is a wonderful advantage, yet few exploit it.

You don’t have to involve yourself in every market movement. In fact,
you should not attempt to. Be an exacting opportunist. Be selective and pick
your entry spots very carefully. Wait until the probabilities are stacked in
your favor before you act. With patience and discipline, you can proﬁt from
market opponents who are less disciplined and less capable than you are.
While you do nothing, less skilled opponents are laying the groundwork for
your success, and you get to wait and watch for free. What a deal!

When a Mistake Becomes a Mistake

The difference between successful investors and unsuccessful

investors is how they react to being invested in a losing stock.

There is absolutely no reason to allow a mistake to become an ego

shattering experience. Being wrong is not the problem. Making

a mistake is not the problem. The problem is being unwilling to

accept the mistake. The problem is staying wrong.

—Dan Sullivan

No matter how smart you think you are, I guarantee you will make an abun-
dance of mistakes over time. We all do. Many of your failed trades may
not even be mistakes on your part, just changes in circumstances that were
impossible to forecast. The real mistake comes when you refuse to make an
adjustment after things change. No one will ever be so good that he or she
will never take a loss. Being wrong is unavoidable, but staying wrong is a
choice. Staying wrong can be deadly; it can take both a physical and a psy-
chological toll on your health. When you deny reality, you are no longer
trading: you’ve sacriﬁced your principal to the fates. The linkages between

C H A P T E R   1 2   R I S K   M A N A G E M E N T   P A R T   1

289

stress and effects such as heart disease and ulcers are well known. To protect
your health, your conﬁdence, and your money, you must learn to release a
bad hand and move on.

If  You’re Not Feeling Stupid,
You’re Not Managing Risk

Sometimes after you sell a stock to cut short a loss, the stock will turn around
and move up in price. This has happened to me thousands of times. Do I feel
dumb or get angry? No. Investing and trading stocks is a business of playing
probabilities so that the proﬁt from winners outweighs the losses over time.
It is completely unrealistic to think you’re going to be right all the time or
think that you can hold losses and they will never leave you broke. Making
you feel stupid is the market’s way of pressuring you to act foolish. Don’t
succumb. Remain disciplined and cut your losses. The alternative to man-
aging risk is not managing risk, and that never turns out well.

This concept should be obvious, but in fact it is too often overlooked.
Although it’s certainly not a secret (it’s the most frequently mentioned subject
in most books written by successful speculators), it’s difﬁcult to do because it
goes against human nature and requires strict discipline and a divorce from
one’s ego. I can’t make you cut your losses any more than I can make you diet
and exercise to lose weight; that’s a personal choice. All I can do is share with
you what I know from my own success and tell you that the stock market is no
place for someone who is easily discouraged by mistakes. Mistakes are lessons,
in other words, opportunities to improve. These experiences are the greatest
part of the learning process. Although cutting your losses won’t guarantee that
you will win in the stock market, it will help ensure your survival.

Why Most Investors Fail to Cut Their Losses

Investors usually become emotionally attached to their stock holdings. They
may put in many hours of careful research building a case for a company,
scouring ﬁnancial reports, and maybe even trying the company’s products.
Then, when their proud pick takes a dive, they can’t believe it. They make

290

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

excuses for the stock’s decline; they call their broker and search the Internet
looking for favorable opinions to back up their faith in the company. They
ignore the only opinion that counts: the verdict of the market.

As the stock keeps sliding, their losses mount. Usually, what happens
is that the stock’s decline becomes so huge and unbearable that they ﬁnally
throw in the towel and feel completely demoralized. Don’t allow yourself to
get caught in this lethal trap. To have lasting success in the stock market,
you must decide once and for all that it’s more important to make money
than to be right. Your ego must take a backseat.

Sounds like a simple decision to make, but think again. Many people
speculate in stocks without getting this one straight. Their self-image rides
on the success or failure of their trades. As a result, they make excuses for
obvious losers rather than admit mistakes. Ultimately, the success of cutting
losses rests on your ability to remove emotion—hope, fear, pride, excite-
ment, and the like—from your investment decisions, at least to the point
where it doesn’t override good judgment.

Most investors fall into psychological traps. Feelings of hope and greed
confuse their decisions to sell their stock holdings at a loss or, for that mat-
ter, at a proﬁt. They ﬁnd it difﬁcult to sell, and so they rationalize a losing
position. They convince themselves that they haven’t taken the loss until
they sell it. Losses are a part of trading and investing; if you are not pre-
pared to deal with them, then prepare to eventually lose a lot of money.

As you can see, I devoted two chapters to risk management. That’s
because in trading and in life, how you deal with losing is the difference
between mediocrity and greatness. Individual stocks are not like mutual
funds, they don’t have a manager and they don’t manage themselves;
you’re the manager. When investing in stocks, everything is not necessarily
going to be “OK” if you just hang in there and wait it out. For a speculator,
small losses are simply the cost of doing business, just as marked-down mer-
chandise is to a retail store operator. A good retail merchant doesn’t hang
on to dead merchandise, hoping a particular style or product will come back
in vogue a year later. If he’s smart, he marks it down, gets it off the shelf as
quickly as possible, and then looks to restock the shelves with something
that everyone wants to buy.

Risk Management

Part 2: How to Deal with

and Control Risk

I have two basic rules about winning in trading as well as in life:

(1) If you don’t bet, you can’t win. (2) If you lose all your chips, you

can’t bet.

—Larry Hite

F or  three  decades, enjoying eight bull markets and enduring

eight bear markets, I have traded stocks; I have accumulated my
personal wealth almost exclusively through stock speculation. After learn-
ing the hard lessons of experience, I have been fortunate to relish consistent
success, preserving not only my original starting capital but the bulk of the
gains. How will you do the same thing? In other words, how will you endure
the test of time, not only winning during bull markets but preserving your
gains in bear markets? The secret is neither hidden nor really a secret. The
key is risk management.

Risk is the possibility of loss. When you own a stock, there is always the
possibility of a price decline; as long as you are invested in the stock market,
you are at risk. The goal with stock trading is to make money consistently
by taking trades that have more reward potential than risk. The problem for
most investors, however, is that they focus too much on the reward side and

291

292

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

not enough on the risk side. Simple as this sounds, few will follow the advice
I’m about to impart to you.

In the stock market, everyone’s goal is to make money. To win in an
environment where everyone has the same objective, you must do the things
that most investors are consciously unwilling or subconsciously unable to
do. If you succeed, when you look back on your career, you will see that an
instrumental difference between you and them was discipline. Over time I
have learned that investors don’t lose money or fail to achieve superperfor-
mance because of bear markets or economic hazards but because of mental
hazards, the types of personal failings that cause you to say to yourself in
retrospect, why didn’t I sell that stock when I was only down 10 percent?
As you’re sitting there down 30 or 40 percent, suddenly a 10 percent loss
doesn’t look so bad.

Does the following sound familiar? You bought a stock at $35 a share
and were reluctant to sell it at $32; the stock then sank to $26, and you would
have been delighted to sell it at the original price of $35. When the stock
then sank to $16, you asked yourself, Why didn’t I sell it at $26 or even $32
when I had the chance to get out with a small loss? The reason investors get
into this situation is that they lack a sound plan for dealing with risk and
allow their egos to get involved. A sound plan takes implementation, which
takes discipline. That part I cannot do for you, but what I can do is teach you
how to do it.

Develop Lifestyle Habits

The difference between mediocrity and greatness lies in the fundamen-
tal belief that discipline is not merely a principle of trading but a princi-
ple of greatness. Managing risk requires discipline. Sticking to your strategy
requires discipline. Even if you have a sensible plan, if you lack discipline,
emotions will creep into your trading and wreak havoc. Discipline leads to
habit. They can be good habits or bad ones; it’s a matter of what you dis-
cipline yourself to do over time. Like most people, when you get up each
morning, you brush your teeth, right? You don’t say to yourself, I’m tired of

C H A P T E R   1 3   R I S K   M A N A G E M E N T   P A R T   2

293

brushing my teeth over and over, so this month I’m taking a vacation from
dental hygiene. To the contrary, brushing your teeth has become automatic
and ingrained from years of repetition and the belief that it’s worth taking
the time to do. This same type of psychological conditioning applies to such
things as exercising and eating healthy, which are lifestyle habits that some
people choose to make priorities in their daily lives.

If you manage your portfolio with your emotions and without disci-
pline, prepare for a volatile, exhausting ride, probably without anything
worthwhile to show for your efforts in the end. Good trading is boring; bad
trading is exciting and makes the hair on the back of your neck stand up.
You can be a bored rich trader or a thrill-seeking gambler. It’s entirely
your choice. With intelligent repetitive work, you can cultivate success-
ful trading habits. Making a habit of doing the things that produce positive
results is worthwhile, but it requires the principle of greatness: discipline.

Contingency Planning

Success is never ﬁnal.

—Winston Churchill

In the stock market and in life, risk is unavoidable. The best anyone can do
is to manage risk through sensible planning. The only way to control risk
when investing in stocks is through how much we buy and sell, when we
buy and sell, and how we prepare for as many potential events as possible.
As a stock market investor, you must learn to sell for your own protection
because you have no control over the forces that move stock prices. Your
goal is not risk avoidance but risk management: to mitigate risk and have
a signiﬁcant degree of control over the possibility and amount of loss.

I don’t like to leave anything to chance in my trading. If I go into a
casino and play blackjack, I know what the odds are, and if I feel like taking
a chance, that’s the best I can hope for. But I don’t gamble with stock trad-
ing, which would be rolling the dice with my livelihood and my security.
The best way to ensure stock market success is to have contingency plans

294

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

and continuously update them as you learn and encounter new scenarios.
Your goal should be to trade without hassles and surprises. To do that, you
need to develop a dependable way to handle virtually every situation that is
thrown at you. Having things thought out in advance is paramount to man-
aging risk effectively.

The mark of a professional is proper preparation. To execute, you must
be prepared. Before I invest, I have already worked out in advance responses
to virtually any conceivable development that may take place. I can’t think
of an event that I’m not prepared for. If and when new circumstances pres-
ent themselves, I add them to my contingency plans; as new unexpected
issues present themselves, the contingency plan playbook is expanded.

By implementing contingency planning in advance, you can take swift,
decisive action the instant one of your positions changes its behavior or
is hit with an unexpected event. You should also be prepared to deal with
proﬁts when they come to fruition. Before the open of each trading day,
mentally rehearse how you will handle each position based on whatever
could potentially unfold during that day. Then, when the market opens
for trading, there will be no surprises; you already know how you will
respond.

You should run your portfolio the way an airline pilot operates a 747
jumbo jet. To ensure the safe passage of the ﬂight, the pilot has advance
plans for every possible contingency: engine failure, severe weather condi-
tions, hydraulic malfunction, and hundreds of other mechanical or elec-
tronic problems. The pilot has considered possibilities ranging from an
electrical storm to trouble with one of the passengers. When a problem
occurs, there is no debate or delay. For every eventuality, the pilot has a
procedure or countermeasure. This comes from training and preparation.
When we’re not prepared, we’re vulnerable. September 11, 2001, was a
grim reminder of the importance of proper preparation. As a result, cockpit
doors are now fortiﬁed, and the sky marshal program put into place during
the 1960s has been expanded. Some pilots are even armed. Learning from
our past mistakes and being properly prepared allow for safer travel and for
safer investing as well.

I have the following four basic contingency plans for my stock trading.

C H A P T E R   1 3   R I S K   M A N A G E M E N T   P A R T   2

295

The Initial Stop-Loss
Before buying a stock, I establish in advance a maximum stop loss: the price
at which I will exit the position if it moves against me. The moment the price
hits the stop loss, I sell the position without hesitation. Once I’m out of the
stock, I can evaluate the situation with a clear head. The initial stop loss is
most relevant in the early stages of a position. Once a stock advances, the sell
point should be raised to protect your proﬁt with the use of a trailing stop
or back stop.

The Reentry
Some stocks set up constructively and may even emerge from a promis-
ing base and attract buyers but then quickly undergo a correction or sharp
pullback that stops you out. This tends to occur when the market is expe-
riencing general weakness or high volatility. However, a stock with strong
fundamentals can reset after such a correction or pullback, forming a new
base or a proper setup. This show of strength is a favorable sign. Often, the
second setup is stronger than the ﬁrst. The stock has fought its way back and
along the way shaken out another batch of weak holders. If it breaks out of
the second base on high volume, it can really take off.

You shouldn’t assume that a stock will reset if it moves against you.
You should always protect yourself and cut your loss. However, if a stock
knocks you out of your position, don’t automatically discard it as a future
buy candidate. If the stock still has all the characteristics of a potential
winner, look for a reentry point. Your timing may have been off. It could
take two or even three tries to catch a big winner. This is a trait of profes-
sional traders. Amateurs are scared of positions that stop them out once
or twice or just weary of the struggle; professionals are objective and
dispassionate. They assess each trade on its merits of risk versus reward;
they look at each trade setup as a new risk or a new opportunity. Some
believe that selling a stock and then reentering the same stock soon after-
ward is amateurish. I believe missing opportunity because of emotion is
as amateurish. Managing risk with the use of stop losses, particularly in a
whipsaw market, can sometimes give a trader the feeling of chasing one’s
tail. Recognize the feelings of frustration and then remind yourself not

296

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

to let ego override good risk management. So you got it wrong the ﬁrst
time—big deal. So you got it wrong the second time—clever ﬁsh! Laugh
and keep your  rod and reel ready. It’s the long-term results that count.
Some of my best trades were in stocks that previously stopped me out sev-
eral times and then reset.

Selling at a Profit
Once a stock amasses a percentage gain that is a multiple of your stop loss,
you should rarely allow that position to turn into a loss. For instance, let’s
say your stop loss is set at 7 percent. If you have a 20 percent gain in a stock,
you shouldn’t allow that position to give up all that proﬁt and produce a
loss. To guard against that, you could move up your stop loss to breakeven
or trail a stop to lock in the majority of the gain. You may feel foolish break-
ing even on a position that was previously a decent gain; however, you will
feel even worse if you let a nice gain turn into a loss.

At some point you have to close out a trade. There are two ways you

can sell:

(cid:115)(cid:0)

(cid:115)(cid:0)

Into strength, which means cashing out shares while the share
price is rising

Into weakness, which means selling while the share price is
declining

Selling into strength is a learned practice of professional traders. It’s
important to recognize when a stock is running up rapidly and may be
exhausting itself. You can unload your position easily when buyers are plen-
tiful. Or you could sell into the ﬁrst signs of weakness immediately after
such a price run has broken down. You need to have a plan for both selling
into strength and selling into weakness.

The Disaster Plan
The fourth contingency may not be one you run into often; however, it’s
one that can save your portfolio and protect all your hard work. It would be
a shame to see years of work building up your account trade by trade com-

C H A P T E R   1 3   R I S K   M A N A G E M E N T   P A R T   2

297

promised by a random black swan simply because you were ill prepared.
The disaster plan could turn out to be the most important part of your con-
tingency planning. In fact, that’s probably a safe bet; the disaster plan deals
with such issues as what to do if your Internet connection goes down or
your power fails. Do you have a backup system? What will your response
be if you wake up and learn that the stock you bought yesterday is set to gap
down huge because the company is being investigated by the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the CEO has skipped the country with embez-
zled funds? What will you do?

The importance contingency planning plays is that it enables you to
make good decisions when you’re under ﬁre, when you need it the most.
To survive in the stock market over the long term, I run my portfolio as if
something really bad were going to happen every day. I am always prepared
for the worst-case scenario.

Contingency planning allows you to have a psychological strategy that is
as robust as your trading strategy as well as a trading strategy that has built-
in responses to potential situations that could, if you are not prepared, lead
to competing thoughts at the precise time you need to implement instant
unbiased action. Contingency planning is an ongoing process. As you expe-
rience new problems, a procedure should be created to deal with them,
which then becomes part of your contingency plans. You’re never going to
have all the answers, but you can cover most of the bases to the point where
your reward outweighs your risk, and that’s the key.

Losses Are a Function of  Expected Gain

Speculation is nothing more than anticipating coming movements.

In order to anticipate correctly, one must have a deﬁnite basis for

that anticipation.

—Jesse Livermore

Life insurance companies run their operations in accordance with mor-
tality tables that are based on population samples, showing the percent-
age  of  people  who  are  likely  to  die  by  a  certain  age.  From  these  tables,

298

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

insurance companies can predict with a high degree of accuracy the number
of people at any particular age who probably will be alive a certain number
of years in the future. Although they cannot tell a particular person how long
he or she will live (just as we don’t know if the next trade will be successful),
the average can be estimated with enough accuracy to set premium levels
accurately. By setting premiums correctly, insurance companies can assure
themselves of having enough money in any year to cover the payments to
beneﬁciaries and the cost of doing business and secure a decent proﬁt.

Just as an insurance company utilizes mortality tables, you can use a
similar method for your trading as I have done for for mine for many years.
You have no control over how much a stock goes up, but you can, how-
ever, control the amount you lose on each trade. You should base that
amount of loss on the average mortality of your gains. This is similar to the
insurance company having control over how much it charges in premiums,
which are a direct function of the mortality tables. Similarly, your losses are
a direct function of the mortality tables of your gains and where they tend
to expire on average.

To make money consistently, you need a positive mathematical expec-
tation for return; you need an edge. That is, your reward/risk ratio must be
greater than one to one (net of costs). To achieve this, your losses obviously
need to be contained on average to a level lower than that of your gains.

During my 30 years trading tens of thousands of stocks, I have been
correct on winning trades only about 50 percent of the time. I’m wrong just
as often as I’m right as far as wins and losses go; however, though the losses
may be the same or at times even greater in number, the dollar amounts the
proﬁtable trades have been much larger than the losses on average. Imagine:
being wrong just as often as being right allowed me to amass a fortune. This
is because I follow a very important rule: always keep your risk at a level that
is less than that of your average gain.

At What Point Should You Cut a Loss?

As I’ve just discussed, the level at which a trader should cut his losses is
not arbitrary. Loss cutting is a function of expected gain. The more accu-

C H A P T E R   1 3   R I S K   M A N A G E M E N T   P A R T   2

299

rately you can predict the level of gain and the frequency at which you can
expect it to occur, the easier it is to arrive at where you should be cutting
your losses.Your maximum stop loss depends both on your batting aver-
age (percentage of proﬁtable trades) and on your average proﬁt per trade
(expected gain).

Let’s assume that a trader is proﬁtable on 50 percent of his trades.
Therefore, he must on average make at least as much as he loses to break
even over time. Although going forward these numbers can only be based
on assumption, it’s the average gain from your actual trades that’s the key
number. After you have calculated these numbers, you will be able to get a
much clearer picture of where you should be cutting your losses. A rule of
thumb could be to cut your losses at a level of one-half of  your average gain.
In the words of Warren Buffett, “Take the probability of loss times the
amount of possible loss from the probability of gain times the amount of
possible gain. . . . It’s imperfect, but that’s what it’s all about.”

Avoid the Trader’s Cardinal Sin

Allowing your loss on a trade to exceed your average gain is what I call the
trader’s cardinal sin. You must make more on your winners than you lose
on your losers, remember? How can you possibly make money over time
unless your winners return more dollars than your losers lose? The fact is
that most traders don’t even know what their average gain is. When setting
a stop loss, I have a rule of thumb that the amount of loss should be no more
than one-half the amount of expected gain based on one’s real-life trading
results. For example, if your winning trades produce a gain of 15 percent on
average, you should sell any declining stock at no more than 7.5 percent off
the purchase price. If you buy a stock at $30 a share, you would set your ini-
tial stop loss at $27.75.

I also suggest that most investors, no matter how large their average
gains, not allow any stock to fall more than 10 percent before selling. If you
can’t time a purchase well enough that you need more than 10 percent ﬂuc-
tuation from your point of purchase, something is wrong with your timing
and selection criteria. Let’s say that you sell your winners for an average gain

300

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

of 30 percent. I would not recommend allowing losses of 15 percent even
though that would be half of your expected gain. In my experience, a 10 per-
cent decline signals that something is wrong with the trade, assuming that
you purchased it correctly in the ﬁrst place.

Over time your average gain will improve as you learn how to trade
more effectively. You should monitor your average gain on a regular basis
and make adjustments to your stop loss accordingly. However, keep in mind
that there’s also an absolute level at which you need to cut your loss: the
“uncle point.” When you were a kid, someone would twist your arm until
you couldn’t take it anymore and said “uncle,” meaning, “Okay, I’ve had
enough; I surrender.” Next time you allow a loss to grow larger than your
average gain, ask yourself how you can you be proﬁtable if your losses are
bigger than your gains.

The best thing you can do is to keep your losses small in relation to your
gains. With more experience, you will become a more effective trader. You’ll
realize larger gains on average and have more money to reinvest. Improved
trading skills will compound your trading account, but only if you keep
your losses small and avoid the trader’s cardinal sin. Never let a loss grow
larger than your average gain.

Building in Failure

I have always lived by the following philosophy: expect the best and plan for
the worst. Systems that rely on a high percentage of proﬁtable trades never
impressed me very much; they expect the best and plan for the best. I always
felt that they were too risky if something went wrong and they lost their
edge. The end result may be the same during periods when things are going
along normally. However, if a trader has to be right on 70 or 80 percent of
his trades and that’s his edge, what happens if he’s right only 40 or 50 per-
cent of the time during a difﬁcult period? What about during a really difﬁ-
cult period? The problem with relying on a high percentage of proﬁtable
trades is that no adjustment can be made; you can’t control the number of
wins and losses. What you can control is your stop loss; you can tighten it
up as your gains get squeezed during difﬁcult periods.

I like to keep my risk/reward ratio intact so that I can have a relatively
low batting average and still not get into serious trouble. It’s a concept that
I call building in failure. My goal is to maintain at least a 2:1 win/loss ratio
with an absolute maximum stop loss of no more than10 percent. I shoot for
3:1, and I’m elated if I can attain this ratio with even a 50 percent batting
average. This means I’m making money three times faster on my wins than
I’m losing when I’m wrong. At a 2:1 ratio, I can be right only one-third of
the time and still not get into real trouble. At a 3:1 ratio, even a 40 percent
batting average could yield a fortune. If I’m able to be proﬁtable with such a
low percentage of winning trades, I’ve built a lot of failure into the system.

Always Determine Your Risk in Advance

The time to think most clearly about where you will exit a position is before
you get in. By the time you purchase a stock, the price at which you will sell
at a loss should already be determined. When a stock drops to your defen-
sive sell line, there is no time for vacillating or second-guessing. There is
no decision to be made; it’s been decided ahead of time. You just carry
out your plan; you should write down your sell price before you buy each
stock. Put it on a Post-it and attach it to your computer screen. If you don’t
write it down, it’s very likely that you will forget about it or start rational-
izing why you should hold on. Not deﬁning and committing to a prede-
termined level of risk cost traders and investors more money than any
other mistake.

Honor Thy Stop

Letting losses run out of control is the most common and fatal mistake
made by virtually every investor, including professionals. Trading without a
stop loss is like driving a car without brakes, it’s just a matter of time before
you crash. As far as I’m concerned, if you aren’t willing to cut losses, you
should not be managing your investments or anyone else’s. Most investors
can’t stand to take losses. Unfortunately, as a result, they suffer much bigger
losses that do lasting damage to their portfolios. This is ironic; they won’t

302

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

take a small loss because their egos won’t let them accept that they have
made a mistake, but in the long run they take larger losses.

My trading results went from mediocre to outstanding once I ﬁnally
made the decision to draw a line in the sand and vowed never again to let
a loss get out of control. I suggest that you make that same commitment
right now.

You should handle a falling stock in your portfolio the way a doctor treats
an incoming patient in the emergency room. If an accident victim just got
rushed into the ER and had lost a great amount of blood, the doctor would act
quickly to stop the loss because the more the patient bleeds, the more likely it
is that he will not recover. As with stocks, the larger the loss is, the more difﬁ-
cult it is to recover because losses work against you geometrically.

Your predetermined stop-loss point should be used as an absolute max-
imum. Once the stock has declined to your stop, sell it immediately without
exception or hesitation. Nothing must prevent you from getting out of the
position. Unfortunately, most investors don’t have a stop, even fewer write
it down, and many do not sell when the stop is triggered. Typically, a stock
declines and the investor says, “On the next rally I’ll get out.” Then one of
two things happens. The stock rallies and in many cases these investors still
don’t sell because they feel comfortable that the stock is ﬁne again, or the
stock never rallies but keeps falling and becomes even more difﬁcult to sell.

If you want to achieve superperformance in stocks, praying and hoping
for a stock to recover from a loss has no place in your psychology. The mar-
ket doesn’t care about what you hope will happen. Inevitably, traders who
think this way continually repeat the error of holding losses “just this once”
and end up with mediocre or losing records of performance in the market.
In fact, such traders frequently go bust. Concentrate on your plan and stick
to your rules; the money will come as a result of sticking to your discipline
and maintaining a positive reward/risk ratio.

Handling Stop-Loss Slippage

At the time you purchase a stock, the price at which you expect to sell at a
loss should be written down and then executed as soon as the stock trades

C H A P T E R   1 3   R I S K   M A N A G E M E N T   P A R T   2

303

at that price. At this decisive moment, you execute the trade as quickly as
you can. Sooner or later, however, one of your stocks will dive under your
sell price before you can react; this is called slippage. My advice is to get out
immediately. Take whatever the next bid price is. Such a hard-falling stock
is sending a warning.

One money manager I know badly mishandled this type of scenario
with a large position. A stock dropped quickly on news and shot well below
her predetermined sell price; she was quickly down 15 percent on the posi-
tion. She called me and asked my opinion. Of course, I told her I would have
already sold if the stock had gone through my stop loss. She instructed her
portfolio manager to wait for the stock to come back and then sell when they
were down only 5 percent. The stock never came back. In fact, it fell further,
and they ended up taking a 60 percent thrashing before they ﬁnally threw in
the towel. Does this sound familiar?

Sure, there are going to be many times when you sell a stock that’s down
and it comes right back up. So what! Stop-loss protection is about protect-
ing yourself from a major setback or, worse, devastation. It has nothing to
do with being right all the time or getting the high or low price. Success in
the stock market has nothing to do with hope or luck. Winning stock traders
have rules and a well-thought-out plan. Conversely, losers lack rules, and if
they have rules, they don’t stick to them for very long; they deviate. The old
adage holds true: your ﬁrst loss is your best loss.

How to Handle a Losing Streak

A losing streak usually means it’s time for an assessment. If you ﬁnd yourself
getting stopped out of your positions over and over, there can only be two
things wrong:

1.  Your stock selection criteria are ﬂawed.

2.  The general market environment is hostile.

Broad losses across your portfolio after a winning record could signal
an approaching correction in a bull market or the advent of a bear mar-

304

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

ket. Leading stocks often break down before the general market declines. If
you’re using sound criteria with regard to fundamentals and timing, your
stock picks should work for you, but if the market is entering a correction
or a bear market, even good selection criteria can show poor results. It’s not
time to buy; it’s time to sell or even possibly go short. Keep yourself in tune
with your portfolio, and when you start experiencing abnormal behavior,
watch out. Jeese Livermore said, “I’m never afraid of normal behavior but
abnormal behavior.”

If you’re experiencing a heavy number of losses in a strong market,
maybe your timing is off. Perhaps your stock-selection criteria are missing a
key factor. If you experience an abnormal losing streak, ﬁrst scale down your
exposure. Don’t try to trade larger to recoup your losses fast; that can lead
to much bigger losses. Instead, cut down your position sizes; for example, if
you normally trade 5,000-share lots, trade 2,000 shares. If you continue to
have trouble, cut back again, maybe to 1,000 shares. If it continues, cut back
again. When your trading plan is working well, do the opposite and pyra-
mid back up.

Following this strategy will help keep you from trading yourself into
the ground when things turn sour, which they deﬁnitely will at some point.
When you take a large loss or get hit repeatedly, there’s a tendency to get
angry and try to get it back quickly by trading larger. This is a major mis-
take many traders make and is the complete opposite of what should be
done. Don’t do it; trade smaller, not bigger. If you keep trading the same
size over and over, even making small mistakes can lead to a death by a
thousand cuts. Instead, scale back your trading size and raise the cash posi-
tion in your portfolio.

A Practice That Will Guarantee Disaster

It would be bad enough to sit and watch your wealth disappear and do noth-
ing to protect yourself by not using a stop loss, but it is even worse to put
more money into a losing investment. Throwing good money after bad is
one of the quickest ways to the poorhouse. This is called averaging down.

C H A P T E R   1 3   R I S K   M A N A G E M E N T   P A R T   2

305

Brokers often talk their clients into buying more shares of a stock that shows
a loss in an effort to sell more stock or rationalize the poor recommenda-
tions they made in the ﬁrst place. They tell the client that it will lower their
cost basis. If you liked it at $50, you’re going to love it at $40, right? Double
up at $40 and your average price is now $45. Wow, what a deal! You now
own twice the amount of stock, and you’ve doubled your risk. Your loss is
still the same; you didn’t gain anything except maybe a double-size loss if the
stock keeps sliding. How about buying at $30, then $20, and then $10? How
ridiculous! There is no shame in losing money on a stock trade, but to hold
on to a loss and let it get bigger and bigger or, even worse, to buy more is
amateurish and self destructive.

High-growth stocks that fall in value after you purchase them at a cor-
rect buy point do not become more attractive; they become less attractive.
The more they fall, the less attractive they are. The fact that a stock is not
responding positively is a red ﬂag that the market is ignoring the stock; per-
ception is not going in your direction. Maybe the general market is headed
into a correction or, even worse, a major bear market.

For many investors, it’s tempting to buy a pullback because you feel
you’re getting a bargain compared with where the stock was trading previ-
ously. However, averaging down is for losers, plain and simple. If this is the
type of advice you’re getting, I suggest you get a new broker or advisor. This
is simply the worst possible advice you can receive. Remember that only
losers average losers.

Learn to Pace Yourself

When I come out of a 100 percent cash position, generally after a bear mar-
ket or intermediate-term correction, I rarely jump right in with both feet.
I think of each trading year as the opener of a twelve-inning game. There’s
plenty of time to reach my goal. Early on, I take it slow with my main focus
on avoiding major errors and ﬁnding the market’s theme. This is like an
athlete warming up and assessing the competitive environment. Themes
can come in the form of how prices are acting in general, industry group

306

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

leadership, overall market tone, and economic and political inﬂuences. I
try to establish a rhythm and set my pace during this time. Like a golfer
who has found his swing groove, once I ﬁnd a theme and establish my trad-
ing rhythm, then and only then do I step up my exposure signiﬁcantly. I
wait patiently for the right opportunity while guarding my account. When
the opportunity presents itself with the least chance of loss, I’m ready to
strike. Patience is the key. My goal is to trade effortlessly. If your trading is
causing you difﬁculty or stress, something is wrong with your criteria or
timing or you’re trading too large. To trade with ease, you must learn to
wait patiently until the wind is at your back. If you were going sailing, you
wouldn’t go out on a dead calm and sit there ﬂoating in the water all day
waiting for the wind to pick up. Why not just wait for a breezy day to set sail?

Build on Success

I view the objectives in trading as a three-tiered hierarchy. First

and foremost is the preservation of capital. When I ﬁrst look at a

trade, I don’t ask, “What is the potential proﬁt I can realize?” but

rather, “What is the potential loss I could suffer?” Second, I strive

for consistent proﬁtability by balancing my risk relative to the

accumulated proﬁts or losses. Consistency is far more important

than making lots of money. Third, insofar as I’m successful in

the ﬁrst two goals, I attempt to achieve superior returns. I do this

by increasing my bet size after, and only after, periods of high

proﬁtability. In other words, if I have had a particularly proﬁtable

recent period, I may try to pyramid my gains by placing a larger bet

size assuming, of course, the right situation presents itself. The key

to building wealth is to preserve capital and wait patiently for the

right opportunity to make extraordinary gains.

—Victor Sperandeo

To make big money in the stock market you do not have to make all-or-
nothing decisions. Stock trading is not an on-off business; moving from
cash into equities should be incremental. As emerging stocks multiply on

C H A P T E R   1 3   R I S K   M A N A G E M E N T   P A R T   2

307

your watch list and the market tries to rally off its apparent lows, the time
will come to test the water with real money. Prudence is the order of the
day here. You should start off with “pilot buys” by initiating smaller posi-
tions than normal; if they work out, larger positions should be added to the
portfolio soon thereafter. This toe-in-the-water approach helps keep you
out of trouble and building on your successes. If you’re not proﬁtable at 25
percent or 50 percent invested, why move up to 75 percent or 100 percent
invested or use margin? Wait for conﬁrmation and require that at least a
few trades work out before getting more aggressive.

Conversely, if your trades are not working as expected, cut back. There’s
no intelligent reason to increase your trading size if your positions are show-
ing losses. By pyramiding up when you’re trading well and tapering off
when you’re trading poorly, you trade your largest when trading your
best and trade your smallest when trading your worst. This is how you
make big money as well as protect yourself from disaster. Before stepping
up my exposure aggressively, I look to my portfolio for conﬁrmation. If the
market is indeed healthy, I should be experiencing success with my trading.
In addition, you should see additional stocks setting up behind the ﬁrst wave
of emerging leaders. Be incremental in your decision-making process. Build
on success. Subtract on setbacks. Let your portfolio guide you.

Scaling In versus Averaging Down

A key difference between professionals and amateurs is that professionals
scale into positions whereas amateurs average down. What do I mean by
this? Let’s assume that both the professional and the amateur decide to risk
5 percent of their capital on a trade. The pro may scale in with 2 percent on
the ﬁrst buy, 2 percent on the second, and maybe an additional 1 percent on
the third. He then might put his stop at 10 percent from the average cost of
his three buys, risking 0.50 percent of the total account capital.

The amateur buys his position, usually at one price, and if the trade
goes against him, he may decide to average down, doubling up on a losing
position. Often amateurs double up several times. Do this three times and
you’ve gone from what started out as a 5 percent position to a 20 percent

308

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

position. If the stock keeps sinking, it becomes even more difﬁcult to sell
because you kept committing to the stock with additional buys. In my trad-
ing, I try to buy or add to a position in the direction of the trade only after it
has shown me a proﬁt; even if I’m buying a pullback, I generally wait for the
stock to turn up before going long. The lesson: never trust the ﬁrst price
unless the position shows you a proﬁt.

When to Move Up Your Stop

I have some basic general guidelines: Any stock that rises to a multiple of my
stop loss should never be allowed to go into the loss column. When the price
of a stock I own rises by three times my risk, I almost always move my stop
up to at least breakeven. Suppose I buy a stock at $50 and decide that I’m
willing to risk 5 percent on the trade ($47.50 stop loss for a $2.50 risk). If the
stock advances to $57.50 (3 (cid:3) $2.50), I move my stop to at least $50. If the
stock continues to rise, I start to look for an opportunity to sell on the way
up and nail down my proﬁt. If I get stopped out at breakeven, I still have my
capital; nothing gained but nothing lost. You may feel dumb breaking even
on a trade that was once at a proﬁt; however, you’ll feel a lot worse if you
turn a good-size gain into a loser. Move your stop up when your stock rises
by two or three times your risk, especially if that number is above your his-
torical average gain. This will help guard you against losses and protect your
proﬁts and your conﬁdence.

Not All Ratios Are Created Equal

You may have heard that in setting a stop loss you should allow more room
for volatile price action; you should widen your stops on the basis of the
volatility of the underlying stock. I strongly disagree. Most often, high vola-
tility is experienced during a tough market environment. During difﬁcult
periods, your gains will be smaller than normal and your percentage of prof-
itable trades (your batting average) will deﬁnitely be lower than usual, and
so your losses must be cut shorter to compensate. It would be fair to assume
that in difﬁcult trading periods your batting average is likely to fall below

C H A P T E R   1 3   R I S K   M A N A G E M E N T   P A R T   2

309

50 percent. Once your batting average drops below 50 percent, increasing
your risk proportionately to compensate for a higher expected gain based
on higher volatility will eventually cause you to hit negative expectancy;
the more your batting average drops, the sooner negative expectancy will
be achieved.

As the next ﬁgure illustrates, at a 40 percent batting average your opti-
mal gain/loss ratio is 20 percent/10 percent; at this ratio your return on
investment (ROI) over 10 trades is 10.2 percent. Note that the expected
return  rises  from  left  to  right  and  peaks  at  this  ratio.  Thereafter,  with
increasing losses in proportion to your gains, the return actually declines.
Armed with this knowledge, you can understand which ratio at a particular
batting average will yield the best expected return. This illustrates the power
of ﬁnding the optimal ratio. Any less and you make less money; however,
any more and you also make less money.

If your winning trades were to more than double from 20 percent to 42
percent and you maintained a 2:1 gain/loss ratio by cutting your losses at 21

Figure 13.1  Total compounded return per 10 trades at various batting

averages

310

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

percent instead of 10 percent, you would actually lose money. You’re still
maintaining the same ratio, so how could you be losing? This is the danger-
ous nature of losses; they work geometrically against you. At a 50 percent
batting average, if you made 100 percent on your winners and lost 50 per-
cent on your losers, you would do nothing but break even; you would make
more money taking proﬁts at 4 percent and cutting your losses at 2 percent.
Not surprisingly, as your batting average drops, it gets much worse. At a 30
percent batting average, proﬁting 100 percent on your winners and giving
back 50 percent on your losers, you would have a whopping 93 percent loss
in just 10 trades.

If the optimal result is achieved by having a 48 percent/24 percent win/
loss ratio at a 50 percent batting average, what do you think happens when
your percentage of proﬁtable trades drops to only 40 percent? The follow-
ing ﬁgure may surprise you by showing that the optimal level drops to 20
percent/10 percent.

If you’re trading poorly and your batting average is dropping off
below the 50% level, the last thing you want to do is increase the room you
give your stocks on the downside. This is not an opinion; it’s a mathemati-
cal fact. Many investors give their losing positions more freedom to inﬂict

Figure 13.2  Total compounded return per 10 trades at 40 percent batting

average

C H A P T E R   1 3   R I S K   M A N A G E M E N T   P A R T   2

311

deeper losses. Their results begin to slip, and they get knocked out of a hand-
ful of trades; then they watch the stocks they sold at a loss turn around and
go back up. What do they say to themselves? “Maybe I should have given the
stock more room to ﬂuctuate; I’d still be in it.” This is just the opposite of
what you should do.

In a difﬁcult market environment, proﬁts will be smaller than normal
and losses will be larger; downside gaps will be more common, and you will
most likely experience greater slippage. The smart way to handle this is to
do the following:

(cid:115)(cid:0) Tighten up stop losses. If you normally cut losses at 7 to 8 percent,

cut them at 5 to 6 percent.

(cid:115)(cid:0) Settle for smaller proﬁts. If you normally take proﬁts of 15 to 20

percent on average, take proﬁts at 10 to12 percent.

(cid:115)(cid:0)

If you’re trading with the use of leverage, get off margin
immediately.

(cid:115)(cid:0) Reduce your exposure with regard to your position sizes as well as

your overall capital commitment.

(cid:115)(cid:0) Once you see your batting average and risk/reward proﬁle

improve, you can start to extend your parameters gradually back
to normal levels.

Diversification Does Not Protect You

I’ve always felt that if I was enthusiastic about an industry or a

company, then I would concentrate in it. It causes commentators to

consider me risky. I never thought that was risk; I thought that was

opportunity.

—Kenneth Heebner

Diversiﬁcation is a tactic used to distribute investments among different
securities to limit losses in the event of a decline in a particular security

312

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

or industry. The strategy relies on the average security having a proﬁt-
able expected value. Diversiﬁcation also provides some psychological ben-
eﬁts to single-instrument trading since some of the short-term variation
in one instrument may cancel out that from another instrument, resulting
in an overall smoothing of short-term portfolio volatility. You will never
achieve superperformance if you overly diversify and rely on diversi-
ﬁcation for protection. During a bear market, almost all stocks will go
down. By having your money spread all over the place, you accomplish
three things:

1.  Inability to follow each company closely and know everything you

should know about the investments

2.  Inability to reduce your portfolio exposure quickly when needed

3.  A smoothing effect that will ensure average results

Depending on the size of your portfolio and your risk tolerance, you
should typically have between 4 and 6 stocks, and for large portfolios maybe
as many as 10 or 12 stocks. This will provide sufﬁcient diversiﬁcation but
not too much. You should not hold more than 20 positions, which would
represent a 5 percent position size if they were equally weighted. All during
my trading career I’ve heard over and over, “You have to be diversiﬁed.” If
Ken Heebner of CGM Funds can move around billions of dollars in just 20
names and still manage to beat the market, a personal portfolio can surely
be managed sufﬁciently with a maximum of 10 to 20 stocks. If you’re a true
2:1 trader, mathematically your optimal position size should be 25 percent
(four stocks divided equally). As a result, a stock that is a big winner will
make a real contribution to your portfolio. In keeping track of 4, 5, or 6 com-
panies, it is much easier to know a lot about each name than it is to follow
and track 15 or 20 companies. If you’re holding many positions, it’s going
to be difﬁcult to raise cash and move quickly when the market turns against
you. Instead of spreading yourself all over the place in a feeble attempt to
mitigate risk through diversiﬁcation, concentrate your capital in the very

C H A P T E R   1 3   R I S K   M A N A G E M E N T   P A R T   2

313

best stocks—a relatively small group—that have exciting things going on.
Watch your stocks carefully and be prepared to move if things take a turn
for the worse.

In  my  career,  I  have  had  many  periods  in  which  I  put  my  entire
account in just four names. This of course corresponds with some of my
most proﬁtable periods. Yes, there is risk, but you can mitigate that risk
with the use of a sound methodology. In the words of Warren Buffett,
“Risk comes from not knowing what you’re doing.” If you are strict with
your selection criteria and demand the best for your portfolio, it should
be difﬁcult to ﬁnd a lot of names that are worthy to be included among
your elite group. Bottom line: diversiﬁcation does not protect you from
losses.

My Walking Barefoot in
Four Feet of  Snow Story

At some time in your life, you’ve heard a story like this, probably from your
parents or grandparents: how they had to walk barefoot six miles uphill each
way to school in four feet of snow, carrying their brother on their back. Well,
I’m going to leave you with my own “in my day” story.

When I started trading in the 1980s, I had no quotes, no charts, and no
research tools to speak of. There was no such thing as an Internet connec-
tion (at least one that I could connect to), no online trading, and no level II
system for the average trader to ﬁnd out where the market was. All I had was
closing prices printed in the newspaper each day and some graph paper to
hand plot charts.

Making matters worse, stock commissions were extremely high: more
than $100 per trade versus $5 or $10 today. Even when discount commis-
sions were introduced, they were still around $60 per side. At the time, how-
ever, that seemed like quite a bargain. Finding out where the market was at
any particular moment was just about impossible for a small-time trader
like me in those days. I had to be resourceful and a little audacious to make
up for the tools I didn’t have.

314

T R A D E   L I K E   A   S T O C K   M A R K E T   W I Z A R D

When commissions ﬁnally came down to a reasonable level, I opened a
trading account at a local discount brokerage house. That brokerage ofﬁce
offered a very useful feature: a stock quote machine in the lobby. These were
not streaming real-time quotes but rather snap quotes that you could pull
up static one stock at a time.

The machine was meant to be a courtesy for customers who stopped
by the brokerage ofﬁce and didn’t invite frequent use. The computer ter-
minal sat on a table without a chair. The message was clear: look once
and move on. That, however, did not discourage me. I stood outside that
branch ofﬁce every trading day, rain or shine, reading the newspaper. Then
I’d go in every 10 minutes or so to check the quotes. Sometimes I’d take a
break across the street for a hot dog or a soda. Otherwise, I didn’t leave my
spot for the entire six-and-a-half-hour trading day. How else could I know
where the market was?

Eventually, I purchased a computer to get market data, but there was no
Internet trading in those days, no point-and-click two-second execution the
way there is today. In those days, I made my money by picking up the phone
and paying hefty commissions.

When people tell me that trading today is too difﬁcult, that the market is
too complex and the pros have all the edge, it makes me chuckle. It’s a much
more level playing ﬁeld today between the amateurs and the professionals.
Even casual investors have tools at their disposal—from online trade execu-
tion to free charts—that I couldn’t imagine in the old days. Today you have
the equivalent of a fully equipped F-16 ﬁghter jet at your ﬁngertips.

Don’t say the deck is stacked against you, retail players can’t win, or
only the professionals make money in the market. These are simply excuses.
I dropped out of school at age 15 with virtually no money and no educa-
tion. If I could make big money in the stock market, think about how well
you can do. There is no reason you shouldn’t be able to achieve far more
than I have.

I’ve always felt that smart people learn from their mistakes but really
smart people learn from other people’s mistakes. I have tried to follow this
philosophy by carefully studying the great traders and innovative thinkers of

C H A P T E R   1 3   R I S K   M A N A G E M E N T   P A R T   2

our time. I have made my share of mistakes and have learned the hard les-
sons. In this book I have presented to you a sound plan that is based on my
experience. It’s now up to you to execute it and stick to the discipline. If you
do, it will be well worth it.

Best wishes!

SEPA® trading methodology, in 1997 Minervini entered the U.S. Investing
Championship posting $250,000 of his own money; he won with a 155 per-
cent return, a performance that was nearly double the next nearest compet-
ing money manager.

Using his SEPA trading strategy, in a ﬁve-year period Minervini gen-
erated a towering 220 percent average annual return with only one losing
quarter. To put that in perspective, a $100,000 account would explode to
over $30 million with those returns.

Mark Minervini is a 30-year veteran of Wall Street. He is featured in Jack
Schwager’s Stock Market Wizards: Conversations with America’s Top Stock
Traders. Schwager wrote: “Minervini’s performance has been nothing short
of astounding. Most traders and money managers would be delighted to
have Minervini’s worst year—a 128 percent gain—as their best.”

Currently, Minervini educates traders about his SEPA trading meth-
odology through a service called Minervini Private Access, a streaming
communication platform that allows users the unique experience of trad-
ing side-by-side with Minervini in real time. He also conducts a live Master
Trader Program, which is an investment workshop where he spends two
days teaching his SEPA strategy and techniques.
